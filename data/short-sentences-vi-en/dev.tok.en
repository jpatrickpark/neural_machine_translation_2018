Rachel Pike : The science behind a climate headline
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
We blow it up and look at the pieces .
But still , we look at the pieces .
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing .
And this is the tower from below .
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us .
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
We have to get special flight clearance .
Thank you very much .
Christopher deCharms : A look inside the brain in real time
You can mimic what you can see .
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
I &apos;m going to tell you about that technology .
People envision this as being very difficult .
It was terribly dangerous .
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .
But now , we have a real technology to do this .
When you do , what do you want to control ?
But I want to leave with you the big question .
Where will we take it ?
Beeban Kidron : The shared wonder of film
We are inveterate storytellers .
As a filmmaker , it worried me .
The films were curated and contextualized .
The outcome , immediate .
And those without friends started making them .
Who was right , who wrong ?
Was the tale told well ?
Was there a hidden message ?
And they themselves had not known they cared .
I was past 40 when my father died .
He never mentioned that journey .
He was never right again .
And his story was hushed as he assimilated .
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning .
Consider &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; as valuable as Jane Austen .
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed .
Thank you .
So who gets to do it ?
But what about that guy ?
In 2009 , I first heard about DIYbio .
I thought so .
The press started calling us .
Let me take you on a little tour .
Biohackers work alone .
We reverse engineer lab equipment .
We genetically engineer bacteria .
We like to build things .
Then we like to take things apart .
We make things grow .
We make things glow .
And we make cells dance .
I &apos;m not going to minimize those concerns .
Now , we follow state and local regulations .
I &apos;ve actually chosen to take a different kind of risk .
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project .
So this stuff is just beginning .
We &apos;re only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg .
Looked like a ladybug , right ?
It actually is a Japanese beetle .
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell .
You can do a lot of things .
It &apos;s really cool .
It just has to follow safety guidelines .
Why not personal biotech ?
Geert Chatrou : A whistleblower you haven &apos;t heard
Thank you very much .
That was whistling .
I &apos;m trying to do this in English .
So I whistled along with him .
I whistled alone . I whistled in the classroom .
But it can also sound like this .
And I just couldn &apos;t .
So , okay , I &apos;m going to America .
I would love to , but why ?
So I immediately called her up , of course .
She didn &apos;t expect me to go there .
And I would have lost my face .
I lost my face .
But actually I did .
That was great fun , of course .
So I quit my day job as a nurse .
You say , &quot; Huh , what do you mean ? &quot;
Well actually , you are going to whistle along .
Why ? Can I go away ? &quot;
No , you can &apos;t .
Actually it &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
No , no , no . It &apos;s four minutes long .
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
So I whistle the tone .
Sorry . I forgot one thing .
You whistle the same tone as me .
I heard a wide variety of tones .
This is very promising .
This is very promising .
Oh , hah .
I &apos;m so used to that .
I start it myself .
Okay , here it is .
Okay .
It &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
Max Westerman : Geert Chatrou , the World Champion &#91; of &#93; Whistling .
Geert Chatrou : Thank you . Thank you .
Francesca Fedeli : Ciao .
So he &apos;s Mario . He &apos;s our son .
But in the end everything seemed to be under control .
So he got the right weight at birth .
He got the right Apgar index .
So we were pretty reassured by this .
So life had to change .
We needed to change our schedule .
As you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
And that has been really a tough time .
And what went wrong ?
I mean , at the end , will he be able to work ?
Will he be able to be normal ?
Honestly , we went down .
So immediately , as Francesca said , we changed our life .
He was looking at us .
We were his mirror .
And that day really changed our perspective .
And we started from our passions .
This short video is from last week .
This is why we are here .
Mario !
And we thank you so much , all of you .
Thank you . Thank you . Bye .
Thank you .
Mark Shaw : One very dry demo
Not anymore .
Porous , nonporous .
So what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
Did you guess the one that was dry ?
And we &apos;re talking really small here .
So very small , but very useful .
And it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
You can see the difference .
It &apos;s that afraid of the water .
So what &apos;s going on here ? What &apos;s happening ?
So what are the applications ?
I mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head .
The applications in a general sense could be anything that &apos;s anti-wetting .
We &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
It could be anti-corrosion .
No water , no corrosion .
It could be anti-bacterial .
Without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well .
It &apos;s going to happen . Wait for it . Wait for it .
It &apos;s happening !
I was burned very badly .
And the nurses told me two things .
This is not just in Hebrew , by the way .
It &apos;s in every language I &apos;ve had experience with so far .
So that &apos;s what I did .
I kept on doing this for a while .
And here &apos;s how it went .
I would pass their sheet of paper .
People now solved seven questions on average .
You say , what &apos;s the probability of being caught ?
How much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught ?
So , we try to test this .
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit .
What about the probability of being caught ?
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
We call this like a personal fudge factor .
Now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
What about increasing the fudge factor ?
No bill ever disappeared .
Think about the following intuition .
These things feel very differently .
Our subjects doubled their cheating .
People see each other behaving .
What does this cause us ?
So , we did another experiment .
The same thing happens .
When we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit , all the same .
That &apos;s it . The task is finished . &quot;
Nobody knew it was an actor .
And they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
Will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ?
Here is what happens .
Here is the thing .
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students .
So it wasn &apos;t so much about the probability of being caught again .
It was about the norms for cheating .
So , what have we learned from this about cheating ?
We &apos;ve learned that a lot of people can cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit .
Of course they would .
And I learned two interesting things .
I felt my intuition was correct . &quot;
Thank you very much .
So thank you , Monochrom .
Sunni , let &apos;s just remind them .
So the first thing we need is more thumbs .
So Eric , come on over .
That is not how you win .
We can really go for it .
So you can see up here .
Perfect .
So this is the kind of simple level , right ?
But there are advanced configurations .
This is called the Death Star Configuration .
Any Star Wars fans ?
And this one &apos;s called the Möbius Strip .
Thirty seconds . Into the network . Make the node .
Stand up ! It &apos;s easier if you stand up .
Everybody , up up up up up !
Stand up , my friends .
All right .
Don &apos;t start wrestling yet .
Grab that thumb !
Reach behind you . There you go .
Any other thumbs ?
Okay , on the count of three , you &apos;re going to go .
Try to keep track . Grab , grab , grab it .
Okay ? One , two , three , go !
Well done . Thank you . Thank you very much .
All right .
So curiosity .
I said &quot; massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling . &quot;
So I provoked a little curiosity .
I &apos;m reaching around and I &apos;m reaching up .
So you used creativity . That was great .
You heard that sound go up in the room .
We have relief . You got to stand up .
We had some contentment .
And it &apos;s truly awesome and wondrous .
And the last emotion of pride .
How many people are like me . Just admit it .
You lost both your thumbs .
It just didn &apos;t work out for you .
So congratulations .
How many of you won just won thumb ?
All right . I have very good news for you .
So congratulations , grandmasters .
Did anybody win both their thumbs ?
Yes . Awesome . Okay .
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status .
Pick off the one that looks easiest .
They &apos;re not paying attention . They look kind of weak .
As soon as you win , suddenly stop .
Wooo !
Thank you .
David Byrne : How architecture helped music evolve
It was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
The sound system was kind of decent .
And there wasn &apos;t a lot of reverberation in the room .
Other places around the country had similar rooms .
This is Tootsie &apos;s Orchid Lounge in Nashville .
The clientele behavior was very much the same too .
And it &apos;s been very exciting .
Is that a kind of model for creativity ?
Okay , Africa .
The music works perfectly in that setting .
It &apos;s no accident .
It &apos;s perfect for that particular context .
It actually improves it .
This is a little bit later .
I think we &apos;re in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
It fits the room perfectly .
This is La Scala .
And the size of the room is not that big .
It &apos;s smaller than this .
But Wagner made an innovation .
He wanted a bigger band .
Okay .
This is Carnegie Hall .
It &apos;s larger than some of the other symphony halls .
They had to be very quiet .
This is Mahler .
Popular music , coming along at the same time .
This is a jazz band .
And a new form of music was born .
People are dancing , shouting and drinking .
&#91; Live music &#93; doesn &apos;t really change that much .
Other singers after him went even further .
This is Chet Baker .
And he &apos;s singing right into your ear .
He &apos;s whispering into your ears .
The effect is just electric .
There &apos;s live music , and there &apos;s recorded music .
And they no longer have to be exactly the same .
And another new form of music was born .
The tempos are medium . It sounds big .
One of the new ones is the automobile .
But now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
The car is a whole venue .
Automobile music , you can share with your friends .
Presumably , this is just for Christian music .
So that doesn &apos;t really work .
And does it happen anywhere else ?
So birds do it too .
Yeah . I think it &apos;s evolutionary .
It &apos;s adaptive .
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
And they &apos;ll vote for that .
We adapt .
We sing .
Thank you very much .
That &apos;s the life everyone sees .
That &apos;s a natural human emotion .
It &apos;s a massive problem .
But we don &apos;t see it on social media , right ?
That &apos;s their problem . &quot;
I came this close to doing it .
See , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
Some people might fear sharks . Some people might fear death .
It &apos;s something you live with . It &apos;s something you live in .
That &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
That &apos;s the stigma .
And I don &apos;t know what the solution is .
We need to speak up and shatter the silence .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
We &apos;re people , and we have problems .
We &apos;re not perfect , and that &apos;s okay .
And I believe that we can .
This is a dream come true . Thank you .
Thank you .
Ronny Edry : Israel and Iran : A love story ?
And the client was saying , no , it &apos;s 10,000 a day .
This is the context . This is where we are now in Israel .
We don &apos;t know people from Iran .
So I &apos;m like , whoa .
And everybody &apos;s crying now .
Because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
It was a huge amount of pictures .
So for a few days , that &apos;s how my living room was .
So here are a few of them .
They have graphic designers . What ?
Crazy , crazy .
So . And now it &apos;s communication .
And then it became news .
Who is everybody ? &quot; &quot; Everybody . &quot;
They said , &quot; Syria ? &quot; &quot; Syria . &quot;
&quot; Lebanon ? &quot; &quot; Lebanon . &quot;
It &apos;s everybody . &quot; The Chinese .
And we were just at the beginning of the story .
Something crazy also happened .
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel . &quot;
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel .
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago .
Because you &apos;re not in the Middle East .
This is the enemy .
What ?
And it &apos;s going both ways .
It &apos;s like , we are showing respect , one to each other .
And we &apos;re understanding . And you show compassion .
And you become friends .
You can go and travel and meet people .
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago .
And that was the end of it .
Remember that image from the beginning ?
At some point we met in real life , and we became friends .
And it goes the other way around .
Just read where those guys are from .
Crazy , yes ?
I know how it can look really bad .
And really , we can be our own ambassadors .
Just raise that . Exactly .
Oh my God .
Don &apos;t cry .
Thank you guys .
Charles Moore : Seas of plastic
Let &apos;s talk trash .
Plastics are also hard to recycle .
It &apos;s diddly-point-squat .
That &apos;s the percentage we recycle .
Now , melting point has a lot to do with this .
but , mostly bottle caps .
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown .
I offered five cents each for bottle caps .
I got plenty of takers .
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected .
That day I ended up spending nearly 60 .
And this .
Now , you can buy certified organic produce .
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations .
We have to throw it away .
All the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ...
Charles Moore : Thank you .
Carolyn Steel : How food shapes our cities
How do you feed a city ?
Yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s rarely asked .
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either .
And it &apos;s an escalating problem too .
And it &apos;s also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed .
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand .
And that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed , by 2050 .
We &apos;re very hungry for fossil fuels too .
None of it makes very much sense .
So how did we get here ?
And it was also fertile .
And in fact , that &apos;s true of every ancient city .
But of course not all of them were that small .
And the food obviously went off very quickly .
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite .
So the grain markets were to the south of the city .
And the same of course was true for fish .
Fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . Same thing .
And then 10 years later everything changed .
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840 .
And they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
And this changes everything .
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography .
It used to be a social event , buying and selling food .
Now it &apos;s anonymous .
We don &apos;t smell food to see if it &apos;s okay to eat .
We just read the back of a label on a packet .
And we don &apos;t value food . We don &apos;t trust it .
So instead of trusting it , we fear it .
And instead of valuing it , we throw it away .
So what are we going to do about that ?
It &apos;s not a new question .
This is the frontispiece of his book &quot; Utopia . &quot;
the ordering principle of his vision .
I believe we already live in Sitopia .
Well I think it looks a bit like this .
By the way , these can be men as well .
We need these people . We &apos;re part of a network .
It &apos;s common . It &apos;s fresh .
It &apos;s part of the social life of the city .
Cows with a view .
Steaming piles of humus .
So Sitopia , for me , is really a way of seeing .
And I think the message of this is very clear .
Because I think it &apos;s an urgent question .
We know we are what we eat .
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
Thank you very much .
Eddi Reader : &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill &quot;
who I &apos;ve got over .
Thank you very much .
So that became a challenge .
It &apos;s a compound curve interior .
That &apos;s the trailer , pretty much finished .
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream .
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
They didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
And there it is , that &apos;s the Bambi 16 .
Elliot Krane : The mystery of chronic pain
Please keep your seat .
A very different feeling .
Imagine , if you will , these two ideas together .
In fact , imagine something even worse .
It was cadaverically cold to the touch .
How can the nervous system get this so wrong ?
And when you turn the switch on , the light goes on .
And when you turn the switch off , the light goes off .
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that .
These glial cells become activated .
The nervous system has plasticity .
It changes , and it morphs in response to stimuli .
Well , what do we do about that ?
What can we do in a case like Chandler &apos;s ?
But the future is actually even brighter .
Thank you very much .
Bruce Aylward : How we &apos;ll stop polio for good
Actually , it &apos;s a really big idea .
This is a polio vaccine .
This is a great technology .
We can take it completely for granted .
But it wasn &apos;t always that way .
People were terrified of this disease .
And it was because of scenes like this .
This disease was terrifying .
There was no cure , and there was no vaccine .
But the reality is that polio still exists today .
This is the picture .
There &apos;s not very much left in the world .
Hundreds of people were paralyzed .
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults .
They had come from thousands of miles away .
And in one case , it originated on another continent .
But the message was very clear .
We &apos;re not trying to control polio .
This virus can only survive in people .
It doesn &apos;t survive in the environment hardly at all .
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
So it was a massive effort .
Even then , kids need many doses of the vaccine .
With polio it &apos;s almost completely different .
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple .
It &apos;s just two drops , like that .
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International .
They &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
Last year , it was 1,000 .
We should abandon this idea of eradication .
Let &apos;s settle for control -- that &apos;s good enough . &quot;
There &apos;s absolutely no question .
These are children like Umar .
Umar is seven years old , and he &apos;s from northern Nigeria .
He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters .
Umar also has polio .
Umar was paralyzed for life .
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances .
The reality of polio today is something very different .
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world .
And we didn &apos;t start with the easy places .
And yet , the impossible is happening .
India &apos;s not unique .
Now we &apos;re in tough times economically .
Help us tell the story .
Thank you .
Where would you say we need to be the smartest ?
It keeps getting reinfected .
They &apos;re going to be the tough ones .
Now what about the money ?
And is it easy to raise that money ?
And what &apos;s it going to be like the next couple of years ?
B It &apos;s interesting .
So good luck . We &apos;re all in this with you .
Thank you .
Frank Warren : Half a million secrets
But soon the idea began spreading virally .
I never did have someone . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve found love . I &apos;m happy . &quot;
&quot; Your mic wasn &apos;t off during sound check .
We all heard you pee . &quot;
Right . You know what I &apos;m saying .
It &apos;s in my pocket right now . &quot;
But she finally did .
And he emailed me this picture .
This one &apos;s my favorite .
&quot; That &apos;s me , my husband and son .
My son &apos;s birth is on this camera .
He turns four tomorrow . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
Voicemail recording : First saved voice message .
Have a real happy birthday , and I love you .
I &apos;ll say bye for now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard ?
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret ?
Sometimes I share that information , yeah .
Tony Porter : A call to men
This is my two at home , Kendall and Jay .
They &apos;re 11 and 12 .
Kendall &apos;s 15 months older than Jay .
Explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
Tell me what &apos;s wrong . I can &apos;t understand you .
Why are you crying ? &quot;
Just go on , go on in your room .
Like a man .
And he &apos;s five years old .
And I think back .
I think back to my father .
We lived in New York City , as I said .
And the limousine empties out .
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city .
And this guy , he was up to a lot of no good .
He was a troubled kid .
He was being raised by his grandmother .
His father wasn &apos;t on the set .
His grandmother had two jobs .
He was home alone a lot .
He was cool . He was fine .
He was having sex .
We all looked up to him .
&quot; Hey Anthony , come on upstairs . &quot;
Johnny call , you go .
So I run right upstairs .
Now I immediately knew what he meant .
There ain &apos;t no first time .
Women are objects , especially sexual objects .
He told me to go in his room .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She &apos;s nude .
Anyway , Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
So when I go in the room , I close the door .
Folks , I &apos;m petrified .
So now there &apos;s a living room full of guys .
It was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
He said to me , &quot; I would be free . &quot;
Thank you folks .
Stanley McChrystal : Listen , learn ... then lead
And you put on the T-10 parachute .
Then you take off .
You sit there , OK .
Then they give you 10 minutes .
Then they give you , &quot; Get ready . &quot;
Then they go , &quot; Outboard personnel , stand up . &quot;
If you &apos;re an outboard personnel , now you stand up .
And at that point , you think , &quot; Hey , guess what ?
I &apos;m probably going to jump .
There &apos;s no way to get out of this at this point . &quot;
So nice air comes flowing in .
The jumpmasters start to check the door .
Jump is a misnomer ; you fall .
Boom .
Now you prepare for the inevitable .
You are going to hit the ground .
You can &apos;t delay that much .
It &apos;s this elegant little land , twist and roll .
And that &apos;s not going to hurt .
They &apos;d be doing everything that we had taught them .
This was my father in Vietnam .
And I had an armored organization at that point .
The enemy didn &apos;t break a sweat doing it .
Sort of leadership by humiliation .
I have to have trust in them and vice versa .
And I also have to build their faith .
And that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
We failed .
The mission didn &apos;t work .
Entirely new requirement .
Also , the people had changed .
And yet , we need to have that shared sense .
Then another thing .
There &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
There &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cumulative .
I said , &quot; Where is he now ? &quot;
And you have to watch and take care of each other .
It &apos;s a promise .
It &apos;s probably more powerful than marriage vows .
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .
That was my journey .
I hope it &apos;s not over .
This isn &apos;t easy stuff .
And it isn &apos;t always fair .
Thank you .
I saw . &quot; What is that ? &quot; I asked .
My wife replied , &quot; None of your business . &quot;
And it &apos;s called affordability .
Close your eyes . &quot;
Because I tried to make it intimate .
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them .
Why I am not getting &#91; any &#93; ?
My God , it &apos;s unbelievable .
You need first funds .
That is my invention .
Why are they coming for , finally , for philanthropy ?
Play video one .
That is my idea .
They are performing puja .
I &apos;m sustaining on seventh year .
I &apos;m doing something serious .
Like that , I never chased Mahalakshmi .
Mahalakshmi is chasing me , I am keeping in the back pocket .
Now 110 countries are accessing it . Okay ?
Thank you very much . Bye !
Stephen Hawking : Questioning the universe
How did the universe come into being ?
Are we alone in the universe ?
Is there alien life out there ?
What is the future of the human race ?
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding .
Distant galaxies were moving away from us .
This was the Big Bang , the beginning of the universe .
If not , what created the universe ?
But we don &apos;t know how life first appeared .
I am discounting the reports of UFOs .
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes ?
That is why I am in favor of manned -- or should I say , personed -- space flight .
Thank you for listening .
Professor Hawking , thank you for that answer .
Thank you very much indeed .
Amanda Bennett : We need a heroic narrative for death
So I went to a party .
I talk to him for hours .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand . Soybeans ?
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar . &quot;
I said , &quot; You jerk . &quot;
Only jerk wasn &apos;t the word I used .
And he said , &quot; Let &apos;s get married . &quot;
&quot; Travel the world and have lots of kids . &quot;
So we did .
And for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
The surgeon emerged from the surgery .
And yet , he did not die .
Mysteriously , he lived on .
He coached Little League for our son .
He built a playhouse for our daughter .
I &apos;m looking for a cure .
So we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty .
Then another year goes by .
Two years go by .
More specialists .
We take the kids to Italy .
We take the kids to Australia .
This time , there &apos;s new treatments on the horizon .
They &apos;re exotic . They &apos;re experimental .
They &apos;re going to attack the cancer in new ways .
So he enters a clinical trial , and it works .
There &apos;s another drug out there .
It &apos;s newer . It &apos;s more powerful .
He started it just two weeks ago .
Perhaps there &apos;s still hope ahead .
So what do I say ?
I say , &quot; Keep him alive if you can . &quot;
And Terence died six days later .
So we fought , we struggled , we triumphed .
We fought together , we lived together .
It was also an expensive fight .
We never got the chance to say goodbye .
We never thought it was the end .
We always had hope .
So what do we make of all of this ?
And what did I discover ?
Yet I had that piece of paper .
We both did .
And they were readily available .
I had them right at hand .
Now , what do the experts call this ?
They say it &apos;s denial .
It &apos;s a strong word , isn &apos;t it ?
The family won &apos;t listen to reason .
They &apos;re in denial .
How can they insist on this treatment at the end ?
It &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in denial . &quot;
It &apos;s not just families either .
You want to help . You want to fix .
You want to do .
I saw it firsthand .
Days before he died .
It &apos;s not a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Maybe I wanted to believe it .
So what do we need ?
Maybe we don &apos;t need a new piece of paper .
So I &apos;ll give you a couple lines from him .
This is a poem about Mark Antony .
Actually , one of Cleopatra &apos;s guys .
And he &apos;s been a pretty good general .
The people are leaving . They &apos;re playing instruments .
They &apos;re singing .
And suddenly he knows he &apos;s been defeated .
The overwhelming presence of hope isn &apos;t denial .
Hope isn &apos;t a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Thank you .
And in these places they are cared for .
But then what ?
All of these were released by us .
Thank you very much .
Shawn Achor : The happy secret to better work
So we were up on top of our bunk beds .
I said , &quot; Amy , Amy , wait . Don &apos;t cry . Don &apos;t cry .
Did you see how you landed ?
Of course , this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past .
And the latter won out .
... with one broken leg .
But normal is merely average .
Most of it &apos;s about murder , corruption , diseases , natural disasters .
Bobo married Amy the unicorn .
Suddenly , something that wasn &apos;t even a possibility became a reality .
Tuesday night it &apos;s school violence and bullying .
Wednesday night is eating disorders .
Thursday night is elicit drug use .
I said , &quot; That &apos;s most people &apos;s Friday nights . &quot;
Silence on the phone .
The absence of disease is not health .
And if I &apos;m more successful , then I &apos;ll be happier .
Your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise .
You &apos;re 37 percent better at sales .
Which means we can reverse the formula .
Thank you very much .
No , they are full of misery .
I &apos;ll never do it again . &quot;
And he came one day back to campus .
He was working in a big bank .
He stayed late at night every day .
And the guy was deeply depressed .
This was what we called the meaningful condition .
There was another condition .
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition .
And if they said yes , they built it .
People were not curing cancer or building bridges .
So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning .
Now we had another version of this experiment .
What happened ?
People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude .
There was one other piece of data we looked at .
What happened in the Sisyphic condition ?
In that condition the correlation was zero .
We basically eliminated it .
And everybody raised their hand .
And everybody raised their hand .
And they came up with all kinds of ideas .
The next experiment was slightly different .
That was the task .
And people did the first sheet .
And we had three conditions .
What happened in those three conditions ?
But what about the ignored condition ?
It turns out it was almost like the shredder .
Now there &apos;s good news and bad news here .
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA .
I put things in the wrong way .
I can &apos;t say I enjoy the process .
And there &apos;s an old story about cake mixes .
But it turns out they were very unpopular .
People did not want them .
Maybe the taste was not good .
No , the taste was great .
It was as if you bought it in the store .
It didn &apos;t really feel like your own .
So what did they do ?
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
Now you had to break the eggs and add them .
We asked people to build some origami .
How much do you want to pay for it ? &quot;
And we had two types of people .
We tried to make it more difficult .
So for some people we gave the same task .
So now this was tougher . What happened ?
They put all this extra effort into it .
Now think about kids .
Your memories and associations and so on .
But imagine this was slightly different .
And you played with them for a few hours .
How much would you pay for them now ?
Most people say not that much .
Those are really tough .
Let me say one last comment .
Is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
I think the answer is no .
Thank you very much .
Amy Lockwood : Selling condoms in the Congo
The DRC is a dangerous place .
There are many health issues as well .
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa .
He said there &apos;s just not in demand .
They like the generics .
And as a marketer , I found that curious .
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like .
They name the condoms things like Vive , &quot; to live &quot; or Trust .
Sex !
Their marketing is slightly different .
The name might not be much different , but the imagery sure is .
It might just save their lives .
Thank you .
Vicki Arroyo : Let &apos;s prepare for our new climate
Half the city is already below sea level .
And how will they cope in a foreign land ?
Infrastructure is going to be affected .
Airports around the world are located on the coast .
But now , a word of caution .
Why ? Well , there are no experts .
There are no quick fixes .
We &apos;re all learning by doing .
But the operative word is doing .
Thank you .
Aubrey de Grey : A roadmap to end aging
Here we go . I &apos;m going to talk about five different things .
I &apos;m going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .
I &apos;m going to talk about feasibility as well , of course .
I &apos;m going to do that in two steps .
Now , I want to ask a question .
Hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ?
That was easy . OK .
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing .
And here is that characteristic .
What part of this do people not understand ?
So really , this is how I would like to describe it .
It &apos;s a global trance .
And that &apos;s true .
What &apos;s not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future .
Right . So the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ?
I &apos;m now going to talk about feasibility .
A very simple definition .
This is not a completely tautological statement ; it &apos;s a reasonable statement .
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .
So then , what do we do about that ?
I mean , that &apos;s a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing , pretty ironclad , doesn &apos;t it ?
But it isn &apos;t .
That &apos;s the wrong answer .
And the reason it &apos;s the wrong answer is because of progress .
Now , they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames .
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough .
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .
In other words , they will be staying ahead of the game .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
I decided to give this a little name , which is &quot; longevity escape velocity . &quot;
Well , it seems to get the point across .
You won &apos;t be able to withstand them .
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
And in order to do that , I need to talk about mice a little bit .
And this is what it is .
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
15 years from the robust mouse .
The public &apos;s perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
And this turns out to be useful .
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
The list on the right is also incomplete .
And there are only seven of them .
They &apos;re categories of things , of course , but there &apos;s only seven of them .
First of all , I &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
Of course one can make a biological argument .
One can say , &quot; OK , what are we made of ? &quot;
What can damage accumulate in ?
It &apos;s got to be long-lived molecules .
We do need to really start trying .
And we &apos;ll just end with a few things .
And you know what happened .
So , you know , this does happen .
There &apos;s a proposal to actually put together an institute .
This is what &apos;s going to take a bit of money .
Not very long . OK .
Thank you .
The genes don &apos;t care but we do ?
AG : That &apos;s right .
AG : If you lose a bit of weight .
Your numbers are a bit out .
AG : There are technical implications certainly .
The water is completely black .
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade , or 29 degrees Fahrenheit .
It &apos;s flipping freezing in that water .
I heard about this lake , Lake Imja .
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level .
So it &apos;s right up in the heavens .
That &apos;s not the worst part of it .
I could barely breathe .
I was gasping for air .
And then I said , carry on . Carry on . Carry on .
I &apos;ve heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have .
I have never , ever heard such utter bollocks .
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
And my team just gave it to me straight .
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days &apos; time .
Take some time to rest and think about things .
Instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
And remember , never ever swim with aggression .
This is the time to swim with real humility .
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later .
And I swam across the lake .
The warning signs are all there .
And then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
So thank you very , very much .
John Hodgman : Design , explained .
Ah yes , a table .
We use these every day .
And on top of it , the juicy salif .
Okay , what is this object ?
I don &apos;t get it .
Does anyone know ? Chi ?
It &apos;s an ... iPhone. iPhone .
Here is my well-loved iPhone .
I like to read books on it .
And yet I forget about it all the time .
So there you go . My name is John Hodgman .
I just explained design .
Thank you very much .
Lakshmi Pratury : The lost art of letter-writing
So I thought , &quot; I will talk about death . &quot;
Seemed to be the passion today .
Actually , it &apos;s not about death .
That &apos;s what I want to talk about .
Handwriting is a disappearing art .
Why can &apos;t we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives ?
But too late .
So what do I plan to leave for my son ?
I plan to publish my own notebook .
Thank you .
Sergey Brin : Why Google Glass ?
Okay , it &apos;s great to be back at TED .
Why don &apos;t I just start by firing away with the video ?
Okay , Glass , record a video .
Google &quot; photos of tiger heads . &quot; Hmm .
You ready ? You ready ?
Go !
Man 6 : Holy &#91; beep &#93; ! That is awesome .
Whoa ! Look at that snake !
Woman 3 : Okay , Glass , record a video !
Man 7 : After this bridge , first exit .
Man 8 : Okay , A12 , right there !
Man 9 : Google , say &quot; delicious &quot; in Thai .
Woman 4 : Google &quot; jellyfish . &quot;
Man 10 : It &apos;s beautiful .
He needs help getting 10 million dollars .
Should it be by just walking around looking down ?
You &apos;re just kind of moving around .
We &apos;ve learned an amazing amount .
It &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
So our first prototypes we built were huge .
It was like cell phones strapped to your head .
It was very heavy , pretty uncomfortable .
But we &apos;ve come a long way .
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera .
I would just light up a cigarette . It would look cooler .
Thank you all very much .
Brené Brown : Listening to shame
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I had a slide that said Breakdown .
It was not really you .
But it was great . &quot;
YouTube , they &apos;re putting this thing on YouTube .
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she goes , &quot; Uh ... no . &quot;
That ... me neither . &quot;
I had no contingency plan for four million .
The majority of people .
Vulnerability is not weakness .
It fuels our daily lives .
We &apos;d like you to come in and speak .
What would you like for me to talk about ?
There &apos;s three big answers .
There &apos;s nothing more vulnerable than that .
And I &apos;m going to be really honest with you .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
I &apos;m a fifth generation Texan .
Our family motto is &quot; Lock and load . &quot;
And then I hear , &quot; Vulnerability TED ! &quot;
I turn around , I go , &quot; Hi . &quot;
&quot; Look away . &quot;
And I see you .
And so I want to walk you in to shame .
And we &apos;re going to walk in .
Here &apos;s why .
Yes ? We heard that .
Yes ?
Myshkin Ingawale , I hope I did right by you .
And he said , &quot; I saw this need .
And he said , &quot; And it didn &apos;t work .
You know what the big secret about TED is ?
This is like the failure conference .
No , it is .
You know why this place is amazing ?
Because very few people here are afraid to fail .
I &apos;ve failed miserably , many times .
You &apos;re not good enough .
You never finished that MBA . Your wife left you .
Shame is that thing .
Us .
Shame is &quot; I am bad . &quot;
Guilt : I &apos;m sorry . I made a mistake .
Shame : I &apos;m sorry . I am a mistake .
And here &apos;s what you need to know .
Guilt , inversely correlated with those things .
It &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
And it &apos;s a straight-jacket .
Weak .
And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t study men . &quot;
And he said , &quot; That &apos;s convenient . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
So I started interviewing men and asking questions .
Very quickly , some research by Mahalik at Boston College .
And that is seductive .
But the truth is that never happens .
We want you to go in .
We want to be with you and across from you .
So thank you all very much . I really appreciate it .
Eric Whitacre : Virtual Choir Live
I took a couple victory laps in there .
Now fast forward to just three years ago .
Could we do this all in real time ?
Could we have people singing together in real time ?
Now , we &apos;ll perform &quot; Cloudburst &quot; for you .
We deal in milliseconds .
Thank you .
Laura Trice : Remember to say thank you
And I asked myself , why ?
I felt shy , I felt embarrassed .
So , I decided to investigate .
And he goes , &quot; Oh , this is great , this is great . &quot;
So , the question is , why was I blocking it ?
Why were other people blocking it ?
And it &apos;s because I &apos;m giving you critical data about me .
I &apos;m telling you where I &apos;m insecure .
I &apos;m telling you where I need your help .
You could neglect me .
You could abuse it .
Or you could actually meet my need .
So , I &apos;m going to challenge all of you .
Go home to your husband -- what does he need ?
And it &apos;s simple .
And why should we care about this ?
We talk about world peace .
So , let &apos;s make it right in our own backyard .
Thank you .
Carter Emmart : A 3D atlas of the universe
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see .
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
for the Cassini mission .
This software can also be networked between domes .
So you &apos;re seeing the edge of the Earth .
This is Nepal .
This is Nepal and Tibet .
We carry that in us .
Thank you .
And when you love , how does it feel ?
And when you desire , how is it different ?
Give me comfort , give me edge .
Give me novelty , give me familiarity .
What is the relationship between love and desire ?
How do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
We want to neutralize the tensions . We want closeness .
Desire needs space .
And when it &apos;s said like that , it &apos;s often quite abstract .
Radiant , as in self-sustaining .
Nobody needs anybody .
There is no caretaking in desire .
For good reasons , right ?
But basically it &apos;s when there is novelty .
What parts of you are just being seen ?
So where do you go in sex ?
What parts of you do you connect to ?
What do you seek to express there ?
What comes out there ? It &apos;s a language .
It isn &apos;t just a behavior .
You know , animals have sex .
It &apos;s the pivot , it &apos;s biology , it &apos;s the natural instinct .
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
And so I began to ask a different question .
And then I began to ask the reverse question .
Translate this into adult language .
&quot; Are you going to be there ?
Are you going to be angry with me ? &quot;
The third child doesn &apos;t really come back .
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm .
Responsibility and desire just butt heads .
They don &apos;t really do well together .
Committed sex is premeditated sex .
It &apos;s willful . It &apos;s intentional .
It &apos;s focus and presence .
Merry Valentine &apos;s .
Nalini Nadkarni : Life science in prison
Trees epitomize stasis .
You might have a guess .
The answer is actually 186,540 miles , or seven times around the globe .
And our prison system itself is stuck .
That number is rising .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
Thank you very much .
Robbie Mizzone : Thank you .
Tommy Mizzone : Thank you very much .
TM : Thank you very much .
RM : I &apos;m just going to take a second to introduce the band .
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny .
He &apos;s also our brother .
And I &apos;m Robbie , and I &apos;m 14 , and I play the fiddle .
TM : We can &apos;t really figure out the reason for this .
It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds .
TM : Thank you very much .
RM : Thank you .
Michael Hansmeyer : Building unimaginable shapes
If we could free ourselves from our education ?
What would these unseen forms look like ?
Would they delight us ?
I propose we look to nature .
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms .
We &apos;re free to choose where we make the fold .
And by doing so , we can differentiate the surfaces .
And in doing so , we can suddenly fold anything .
A simple volume , the cube .
And we can play with this .
We can begin to sculpt the form .
Surfaces can become porous .
They can stretch . They can tear .
But in each case , I didn &apos;t design the form .
I designed the process that generated the form .
So , for instance , we can plot the length of the edges .
So let &apos;s bring this process to architecture .
How ? And at what scale ?
I chose to design a column .
Columns are architectural archetypes .
I started using four cylinders .
And these columns , they have information at very many scales .
We can begin to zoom into them .
These forms are undrawable .
In this case , the process is deterministic .
So this leads to a new role for the architect .
But enough of the theory .
There &apos;s been a lot of talk now about 3D printing .
But it is increasingly possible .
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale .
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
So where does this leave us ?
In short , we have no constraints .
Thank you .
David Hoffman : Sputnik mania
The rocket was huge .
On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
All hell broke loose .
It provoked the missile gap .
It exploded an arms race .
It began the space race .
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
&quot; Sputnik &quot; will soon be released .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
Thank you , Chris .
Harish Manwani : Profit &apos;s not always the point
But the question is easier said than done .
But how do we actually get that done ?
There are things that you stand for .
You &apos;re here to change lives .
We are a company that sells soap and soup .
Small actions can make a big difference .
We have 60,000 such women now in India .
Small actions , big difference .
So just think about it .
And I can go on and on .
Now the question here is , where do we go from here ?
Thank you very much .
Susan Cain : The power of introverts
When I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time .
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
Rowdie , rowdie , let &apos;s get rowdie . &quot;
Yeah .
I did my best .
And I felt kind of guilty about this .
It &apos;s different from being shy .
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .
But now here &apos;s where the bias comes in .
I &apos;ll give you some examples .
So ...
And do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
One answer lies deep in our cultural history .
So that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
That &apos;s our cultural inheritance .
Guess what ?
Books .
I have a suitcase full of books .
Here &apos;s Margaret Atwood , &quot; Cat &apos;s Eye . &quot;
Here &apos;s a novel by Milan Kundera .
But here &apos;s the thing about my grandfather .
And that actually helped a lot .
I mean , we are .
Just stop it .
Thank you .
That is great .
School , same thing .
This is especially important for extroverted children too .
Okay , number two : Go to the wilderness .
Be like Buddha , have your own revelations .
Or maybe they &apos;re full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment .
And that &apos;s okay .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
And then there was another influence .
&quot; You know , do people really use it ?
And I didn &apos;t want to be a colorist .
It wasn &apos;t what I wanted to do .
And then finally , the leaf lamp for Herman Miller .
So , we had to design both the light and the light bulb .
So , the light bulb actually does that .
And this is what we &apos;re pursuing here .
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique .
It &apos;s really about designing from the inside out .
And then , of course , design is never done .
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
Thank you .
This picture is incredible .
I didn &apos;t really want to , from the previous adventure .
And I think this is something really important .
I mean it &apos;s colorful , it &apos;s fun .
Like paper , paper and cardboard .
And we also designed the condoms themselves .
Of course , clubs and discos , too .
And here &apos;s the public service announcement for this project .
Get some .
Yeah ? All right , all right . I have only a few .
So , thank you .
The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution .
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
We don &apos;t have to do it that way anymore .
This is a beefalo .
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid .
I think they said it tasted like chicken .
This is a cama .
And they are now using these in certain cultures .
Then there &apos;s the liger .
It &apos;s bigger than a tiger .
And then finally , everybody &apos;s favorite , the zorse .
None of this is Photoshopped . These are real creatures .
These are normal cells .
They did it with pigs .
They did it with puppies .
And , in fact , they did it with monkeys .
Be easier to find us at night .
Other states have banned them .
This is Prometea , the first cloned horse .
In other words , the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed .
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies .
That DNA is passed down through our mothers .
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that .
They can &apos;t actually make them land .
It &apos;s not just insects .
They &apos;ve now created an organic robot .
We &apos;ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &quot;
I &apos;ll get back to that in a minute .
There &apos;s also been work done with monkeys .
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke .
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida .
This is a brain from a lamprey eel .
It &apos;s photophilic .
This is where we are in this process .
This is what Frankenstein &apos;s lab looks like .
And so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
Is everything okay ?
Thanks .
Let me introduce to you Rezero .
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots .
Now we &apos;ll explain that in a second .
Let &apos;s play a little .
I can also make him spin .
He &apos;s now keeping a constant distance to Thomas .
We call this the orbiting mode .
All right , thank you , Thomas .
Now , what &apos;s the use of this technology ?
And these are more practical applications .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Do you know which group you &apos;re in ?
But first , my disclosures .
I &apos;m not a radiologist .
Fortunately , her lump proved to be benign .
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines .
But that very fact is telling .
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined .
But what else could I offer her ?
What about ultrasound ?
Think about iPods compared to stereos .
But it &apos;s the exact opposite in health care .
It &apos;s just way too much equipment .
It &apos;s like the essence of TED .
This is an image from our first patient .
This is our current detector .
And you can see that it looks a lot different .
So how does this work ?
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer .
So here &apos;s an example .
Our big break came in 2004 .
MBI found 83 percent .
Here &apos;s an example from that screening study .
In this case , a one-centimeter tumor .
MBI generates four images per breast .
MRI generates over a thousand .
First , know your density .
Of course we should .
Thank you .
Pranav Mistry : The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology
There are an enormous number of them that we use every day .
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs .
What we are interested in is information .
We want to know about things .
We want to know about dynamic things going around .
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
Whatever you &apos;re doing with your hands , it &apos;s understanding that gesture .
You can start painting on any wall .
But we are not only tracking one finger , here .
Thank you .
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving .
You can of course watch movies .
and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54 . &quot; ) And you can of course play games .
Paper world is interesting to play with .
That &apos;s all . Thank you .
Thank you .
So , Pranav , first of all , you &apos;re a genius .
This is incredible , really .
Or is this research forever , or what ?
Open source ? Wow .
Are you going to come back to India with some of this , at some point ?
PM : Yeah . Yes , yes , of course .
What are your plans ? MIT ?
India ? How are you going to split your time going forward ?
It &apos;s an honor to have you at TED .
Thank you so much .
That &apos;s fantastic .
Kevin Stone : The bio-future of joint replacement
So let me just start with my story .
And it &apos;s not just aging that causes arthritis .
Let &apos;s consider an alternative path .
I &apos;m not ready for joint replacement . &quot;
And &#91; the allograft &#93; replaces &#91; the missing meniscus &#93; .
Well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough donor cycles .
And the tissue &apos;s very expensive .
I can &apos;t grind it up in a blender .
And we call that a &quot; gal stripping &quot; technique .
What we do is humanize the tissue .
So what about the next step ?
Well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
So that &apos;s our biologic approach right now .
We &apos;re going to rebuild your knee with the parts .
We &apos;re going to resurface it with a completely new surface .
We can harness those benefits .
And so welcome to super biologics .
It &apos;s not hardware .
It &apos;s not software .
It &apos;s bioware .
It &apos;s version 2.0 of you .
Thank you very much .
Marcel Dicke : Why not eat insects ?
That &apos;s quite a lot .
Because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
But this is quite good .
Why not eat insects ? Well first , what are insects ?
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars .
What do they do ?
They remove dung , they pollinate our crops .
They &apos;re at the start of food chains .
Small animals eat insects .
Even larger animals eat insects .
There &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
And they prepare it in a wonderful way .
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety .
What are you eating ?
Some fruits get some insect damage .
And that &apos;s your view of a tomato .
So anything is a good protein source already .
We &apos;re even doing this on purpose .
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros .
One gram of gold is 30 euros .
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially .
How are we going to feed this world ?
And we eat quite a lot of it .
In the developing world it &apos;s much lower .
It &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
But it &apos;s increasing enormously .
They have the same share that we have .
The first problem that we &apos;re facing is human health .
Pigs are quite like us .
You get a new disease that can be deadly .
So that &apos;s one point for insects .
And there &apos;s the conversion factor .
So if you would be an entrepreneur , what would you do ?
We &apos;re not taking the bonus yet .
We &apos;re not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
So that &apos;s two points for insects .
And there &apos;s the environment .
So less waste .
So that &apos;s three points for insects .
So that &apos;s four points for insects .
So the question is , why not eat insects ?
We &apos;ll have to .
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .
It &apos;s just very good food .
You can vary enormously .
It has many benefits .
Who wouldn &apos;t like to eat a shrimp ?
They are delicacies .
So why are we not eating insects yet ?
Well that &apos;s just a matter of mindset .
So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects .
Well they are .
A Dutch chocolate maker .
So there &apos;s even a lot of design to it .
It &apos;s really taken off the ground .
So why not eat insects ?
You should try it yourself .
Look at them first . Look at them first .
Marcel Dicke : It &apos;s all protein .
That &apos;s exactly the same &#91; one &#93; you saw in the video actually .
And it looks delicious .
MD : Thank you .
1.1 million of them .
And then the financial collapse happened .
Currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
There is no way back home .
So let &apos;s forget your environmental footprint .
Let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
Thank you .
Kevin Surace : Eco-friendly drywall
What &apos;s happening to the climate ?
It is unbelievably bad .
So we all look at what we can do .
So we ran off to a sushi bar .
And it was something called EcoRock .
We did the line install over the summer .
We started right there , with absolutely nothing .
That &apos;s the finished production line there .
We got our first panel out on December third .
But this has a huge , huge impact on the environment .
Thank you . Thank you .
We must change everything .
We &apos;re going as fast as we can .
Those are my kids , Natalie and David .
Thank you so much .
Shigeru Ban : Emergency shelters made from paper
Hi . I am an architect .
Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
So it &apos;s very useful .
Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
After , the building was recycled .
So that was the goal of my design .
Thank you . I had one big problem .
That was the problem .
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
They have money and power .
Those are invisible .
That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
We can make it better .
Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
Over two million people became refugees .
But over two million people cut trees .
The color coordination is very important .
So I remember it was so disappointing .
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
And I was very lucky .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
People suffer mentally and physically .
But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
Many of the people want to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
So this is under construction .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Here &apos;s the problem facing Homer .
Place cells are also being recorded in humans .
Do people have grid cells ?
So back to Homer .
Maybe it &apos;s been towed .
Thank you very much .
Nigel Marsh : How to make work-life balance work
Not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out .
We should stop looking outside .
I &apos;m talking about all companies .
And it went like this : wake up well rested after a good night &apos;s sleep .
Have sex .
Walk the dog .
Have breakfast with my wife and children .
Have sex again .
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
Do three hours &apos; work .
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
Meditate for half an hour .
Have sex .
Walk the dog . Have sex again .
Go to bed .
We need to be realistic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
It &apos;s totally dominated by work .
All of my relationships have failed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life apart from my work .
So I joined a gym . &quot;
Now that can be daunting .
And I understand .
Moreover , I think , it can transform society .
&quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
&quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
Values are a certain kind of fact .
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
Probably not .
And morality relates to these truths .
And these await our discovery .
We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
The concept of physical health is undefined .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
Why would we think this ?
But it clearly admits some exceptions .
Now , what stands in the way of this ?
He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
On the left you have Edward Witten .
He &apos;s a string theorist .
I &apos;m not a fan . &quot;
I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
But this is just the point .
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
Thank you very much .
So , some combustible material there .
But can you reconcile that ?
So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
Kathryn Schulz : On being wrong
My friend looks at me totally blankly .
Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area .
We get it in the abstract .
The human species , in general , is fallible -- okay fine .
I think this is a problem .
One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
Dreadful . Thumbs down .
Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
That &apos;s when he falls .
I call this error blindness .
Think back for a moment to elementary school .
This is not mine , by the way .
We learn these really bad lessons really well .
Okay , so fine .
So let me tell you a story .
Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
Everything seems to have gone fine .
So this is a huge practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
So this is a catastrophe .
It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
I mean , this is life .
Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ?
So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another conference .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you guys .
Neil MacGregor : 2600 years of history in one object
It doesn &apos;t , I agree , look very much .
It &apos;s about the size of a rugby ball .
And you all know roughly the story .
He &apos;d ransacked , desecrated the temple .
Belshazzar , his son , decides to have a feast .
And Cyrus makes a declaration .
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising .
He &apos;ll let them return to their countries .
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple .
It &apos;s a central document in Jewish history .
Who is there among you of his people ?
Two great texts , what about the politics ?
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC .
And it had to be run in a quite new way .
It had to be run in different languages .
All of those are respected by Cyrus .
And it enters now another story .
No other evidence .
Suddenly , this appeared .
It &apos;s a great 19th century moment .
&quot; Marduk , we hold , called Cyrus by his name . &quot;
It can only be Jehovah .
The question is , which god was it ?
That &apos;s 1879 .
You all know what happened .
And another story of the cylinder begins .
Cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the Shah .
Then another Iran-Iraq war .
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus .
It &apos;s the only object they want .
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder .
And last year , the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time .
It was a huge event .
This is the other side of that same picture .
It was a narrative presented by the president himself .
It stands with the American constitution .
Thank you .
Joshua Klein : A thought experiment on the intelligence of crows
So , this is a vending machine for crows .
And he said that was impossible .
So I did .
So , for example , rats are incredibly responsive breeders .
And so I built the vending machine .
We &apos;re seeing a population boom with crows .
So that &apos;s no great surprise .
And I &apos;ll give you an example of that .
So this is Betty . She &apos;s a New Caledonian crow .
But the researchers had a problem .
You see , it wasn &apos;t working very well .
So she adapted .
But she did it all on her own .
Right .
Yeah . All right .
That &apos;s the part where the researchers freak out .
It &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
And the next month . And after summer break .
So -- the moral being , don &apos;t piss off crows .
It &apos;s fairly interesting .
Wait for the light to stop the traffic .
Then , collect your cracked nut in safety .
Joshua Klein : Yeah , yeah . Pretty interesting .
In fact , that &apos;s old hat for crows .
Parents seem to be teaching their young .
They &apos;ve learned from their peers . They &apos;ve learned from their enemies .
So we know that there &apos;s lots of crows .
So that &apos;s what we did .
This is a vending machine for crows .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
And eventually , they eat up all the peanuts .
And so this goes on for some time .
Come back , look for the peanut , go away .
Crows , on the other hand , show up , and they try and figure it out .
They figure it &apos;s gotta have more to it .
And then , we &apos;re off to the races .
Or maybe do search and rescue ?
Thanks very much .
David Logan : Tribal leadership
We &apos;ll go back a little more than a year .
It was February 3rd , 2008 .
Like , &quot; Do we like the Budweiser commercial ? &quot;
All of you are members of tribes .
So here is the bottom line .
And so people form tribes .
They always have . They always will .
But here &apos;s the rub .
Now here is the net out of this .
You &apos;re all a member of tribes .
Now , this is the lowest of the stages .
You don &apos;t want this . Okay ?
It &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
But let &apos;s move on to Stage Two .
It will be despairing hostility .
Actually , no , I &apos;m not .
You find them in all places in society .
What kind of innovation would get done ?
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?
In fact it would be basically nil .
And we park . And we stay .
Stage Three says , &quot; I &apos;m great . And you &apos;re not . &quot;
I &apos;m great and you &apos;re not .
A whole group of people communicating that way , talking that way .
But , in this case , three doctors walk into an elevator .
And the other said , &quot; No . That &apos;s great . Congratulations ! &quot;
And the elevator door opened , and they all walked out .
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe .
Like , oh , I don &apos;t know , TEDx USC .
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four .
Let &apos;s take a look at a quick video snippet .
This is their lobby .
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth .
Notice people are applauding for us .
But you &apos;ll notice the level of excitement .
And you &apos;ll notice they are a little bit weird .
There is , in fact , another stage .
Now , some of you may not recognize the scene that &apos;s up here .
In fact , South Africa has not gone down that road .
Saying , &quot; We &apos;re great &quot; -- that sounds pretty good .
We &apos;re great ! Who is not great ? England ! &quot;
Sorry .
What about Martin Luther King ?
Two percent are at Stage One .
And our values are beginning to unite us . &quot;
And those are the ones that change the world .
I don &apos;t know anybody .
In fact , that &apos;s progress .
That &apos;s called a triadic relationship .
Pretty much everybody else who does polls .
So , they were bored .
Incidentally , they did pull it off .
First of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
You remember to talk all five culture stages .
Thank you very much .
Frederick Balagadde : Bio-lab on a microchip
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization .
Thank you very much .
Jonathan Drori : The beautiful tricks of flowers
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are ?
And flowers are a real bugger .
They &apos;re really difficult for plants to produce .
Evolution works that way .
And they get up to all sorts of tricks .
And sure enough , there &apos;s the insect .
Now this is a plant .
And this is the mimic .
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant .
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom .
It &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
So it &apos;s deceiving on two levels -- fabulous .
And the flowers don &apos;t really have to be that gaudy .
This one doesn &apos;t smell so good .
So flies love this .
They fly in and they pollinate .
It &apos;s really horrible .
And blowflies just can &apos;t help themselves .
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset .
This is the philodendron selloum .
This is the most amazing thing .
This thing does something else which is unusual .
There &apos;s a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature .
And what a wonderful thing it is .
So there &apos;s something that goes on off the end there .
Well yes we can .
So what is an insect seeing ?
And this is what it looks like with visible light .
Most bees don &apos;t perceive red .
And that &apos;s a real fantastic bull &apos;s eye .
And that &apos;s the sort of thing that it would be seeing .
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful .
And I love the idea of something hidden .
Thank you very much .
Srdja Popovic : How to topple a dictator
But you need to share it with the world . Okay ?
Curiosity killed the cat . You take the bet .
Well , people power has been there for a while .
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India .
It helped Martin Luther King win a historic racial struggle .
Well , first one , analytic skills .
What is the average age of Egyptians ? 24 .
How long was Mubarak in power ? 31 .
It seems that Generation Epsilon is coming .
Now let me set another example .
And , I mean , there is a set of conditions .
Let me give you the example .
I am coming from a country called Serbia .
Guess what ? That was the day of his defeat .
They appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt .
I will give you a counter-example .
You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko .
You will know the outcome .
So unity is a big thing , and this can be achieved .
That thing doesn &apos;t exist in the world .
Now let me move to another place .
It &apos;s selection of strategies and tactics .
First , you start small .
It &apos;s only 200 of us in this room .
They &apos;re very useful in a violent oppression .
So it works like in a video game .
You have a fear high , you have status quo .
Well , that &apos;s just the beginning of the show .
The real show starts when the police appears .
Arrest the shoppers with kids ? Doesn &apos;t make sense .
When you start to mock them , it hurts .
Don &apos;t mix tools with the substance .
But here is also the bad news .
Are they going to become the world wave ?
This is the difference between two towns .
Now , what &#91; do &#93; the statistics have ?
This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon .
Thank you .
Gordon Brown : Wiring a web for global good
This is Tiananmen Square .
They protested across Britain .
Now look at what &apos;s happened in the last 10 years .
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery .
My husband too has spent a long time in prison . &quot;
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this .
Take the financial crisis .
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone .
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life .
It said &quot; David , age 10 . &quot;
David : ambition to be a doctor .
Favorite sport : football . What did he enjoy most ?
Making people laugh .
How did he die ?
Tortured to death .
And we never did .
So my argument today is basically this .
We have the means by which we could create a truly global society .
They said , &quot; Let &apos;s march . &quot;
We should be marching towards a global society .
Thank you .
Oliver Sacks : What hallucination reveals about our minds
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
But there are also hallucinations as well , and hallucinations are completely different .
They don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
They don &apos;t seem to be under our control .
I went in to see her .
So I said , &quot; What sort of things ? &quot;
A man who turns towards me and smiles .
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
Animals too .
Then , one night , the scene changes .
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .
They come to a certain point and then stop .
Then it changes again .
I said , &quot; Is this like a dream ? &quot;
She said , &quot; It &apos;s got color . It &apos;s got motion .
But it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
And she has a sense of humor .
She knew it was a hallucination .
She had no control over them .
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
Well , I examined her carefully .
She wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
But she was blind .
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome .
There is nothing wrong with your brain . There is nothing wrong with your mind .
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
She said , &quot; Who is this Charles Bonnet ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Did he have them himself ? &quot;
Well , so I did tell the nurses .
Now this , for me , is a common situation .
I work in old-age homes , largely .
His grandfather had these hallucinations .
His grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
He &apos;d had cataract surgery .
His vision was pretty poor .
And he knew it was a hallucination .
You don &apos;t have handkerchiefs in midair .
And then the handsome young men disappeared .
It &apos;s typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .
They don &apos;t usually fade in and out .
They are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
That was the only figure he recognized .
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
And you start to see things .
The things you see can be very complicated indeed .
She had very mobile hallucinations as well .
A lot of them had to do with a car .
And , above all , she would see cartoons .
And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog .
Why Kermit ?
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . &quot;
And these frightened her .
Well , what is going on with these people ?
They seduce you . They humiliate you .
They jeer at you .
You interact with them .
You &apos;re at a particular road junction .
You smell chestnuts roasting .
You hear the traffic . All the senses are involved .
And you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
And it &apos;s that Tuesday evening back in 1982 .
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different .
And one of the second commonest is cartoons .
So , what is going on ?
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns .
You don &apos;t form images with your primary visual cortex .
And in particular , one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .
It &apos;s very interesting that that should be specific .
&quot; Face cells &quot; were discovered around 1970 .
I saw an Aston Martin this morning .
I had to bring it in .
And now it &apos;s in there somewhere .
Suddenly this , and suddenly that .
&quot; Kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
Think of the number of blind people .
Thanks very much .
That was superb . Thank you so much .
Well , yeah , a lot of them .
And actually I &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
And I see the geometrical hallucinations .
But they stop there .
And they don &apos;t disturb you ?
That was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
Thank you so much for sharing .
OS : Thank you . Thank you .
One was a passion for rodents .
I also had a passion for Africa .
Africa was truly fascinating for me .
We &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
We chose rats .
Why would you choose rats ?
Because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
There &apos;s a target somewhere here .
There , the animal finds a mine .
It scratches on the soil .
And the animal comes back for a food reward .
Very , very simple .
Very sustainable in this environment .
Here , the animal gets its food reward .
And that &apos;s how it works .
Very , very simple .
Now why would you use rats ?
They &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
Now how do we communicate with rats ?
This consists of 400 square meters .
Question of scale .
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique .
Microscopy , the standard WHO procedure , reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability .
So how does it work ?
You have a cassette with 10 samples .
Here it &apos;s already at the third sample .
This is a positive sample .
But let &apos;s stick first to tuberculosis .
Microscopy for 1,800 patients .
So this is really considerable .
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
So , to standardize this .
This is in a prototype stage .
We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
Thank you very much .
Amy Tan : Where does creativity hide ?
OK .
And I had a miniature poodle .
And it wasn &apos;t bad , but it wasn &apos;t really creative .
There was a reason for everything .
And this happens constantly in the writing .
You won &apos;t discover anything .
And they all operate at the same time .
There is also a big question of ambiguity .
A very famous Chinese saying , she said .
And they also have to make a living , and people need to be fed .
And then we have intentions .
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been .
What are we supposed to do ?
I got these hints everywhere .
And what I need , in effect , is a focus .
And it seems like it &apos;s happening all the time .
And you are noticing it more often .
But you apply this .
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions .
Why or why not ?
This leads to this question .
It seems so obvious , and yet it is not .
In writing a story , it is the place where I begin .
Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems .
And I needed to find something historically that would match that .
And that goes into the story , too .
What is the nature of accidents ?
Responsibility was assigned to the family .
It &apos;s the son , not the father . &quot;
So , there are never complete answers .
There she is .
Thank you very much !
Andrew Fitzgerald : Adventures in Twitter fiction
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s .
And from those single points emanated stories .
Some of them were familiar stories .
Some of them were new stories .
Think about episodes that happened live on radio .
There are thousands upon thousands of them .
There was no mediator between him and the audience .
So this whole project was an experiment .
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind .
Now Twitter , of course , has a 140-character limit .
when this woman falls to her death .
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism .
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme .
And they engage with the real world .
They respond to it .
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
It was Mayor Emanuel .
I double checked the newspapers .
And then , very interestingly , it came to an end .
It ended , a true narrative conclusion .
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format .
Thank you .
Rachelle Garniez : &quot; La Vie en Rose &quot;
Catherine Bracy : Why good hackers make good citizens
I &apos;m going to talk about hackers .
It &apos;s about critical thinking .
Betsy Ross was a hacker .
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack .
So keep that in mind .
All of you are potential civic hackers .
So what does civic hacking look like ?
They asked citizens to write the content .
So you &apos;ve heard of a hack-a-thon .
I authored this answer , and a few others .
They actually love it .
So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House .
But instead of taking to the streets , they issued a challenge .
They can actually build government .
We have 31 brigades in the U.S.
So please come hack with us .
Thank you .
I heard the word &quot; carcinoma . &quot;
Yes , breast cancer .
I thought I knew what fear was .
But it wasn &apos;t easy .
Believe me , it definitely wasn &apos;t easy .
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep .
It was excruciatingly painful , but I did it .
Difficult .
And slowly , I moved out of that miserable state of mind .
But I needed something else .
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini , of Durga .
Durga , the fearless one .
My story is the power of thought .
My story is the power of choice .
It &apos;s the power of focus .
My story is the power of a metaphor .
It &apos;s the power of an image .
She was also called Simhanandini , the one who rode the lion .
Thomas Dolby : &quot; Love Is a Loaded Pistol &quot;
It &apos;s about Billie Holiday .
But I know where she was .
And she was hot .
Jeremy Gilley : One day of peace
And when I was 12 , I became an actor .
I was told I was dyslexic .
In fact , I have got qualifications .
Maybe I could become a filmmaker .
Because it &apos;s obviously incredibly frightening .
Is that a responsible thing to do ? Etc . , etc .
And that was when I had the idea .
There was no starting point for peace .
There was no day of global unity .
There was no day of intercultural cooperation .
So obviously we didn &apos;t have any money .
I was living at my mom &apos;s place .
And we started writing letters to everybody .
He was a prisoner of war .
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki .
So he was like my hero .
And very quickly , some letters started coming back .
And we started to build this case .
And I remember the first letter .
And we didn &apos;t have money for the flight .
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward .
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
For me , it was really about the process .
It wasn &apos;t about the end result .
And that &apos;s the beautiful thing about the camera .
So anyway , we began the journey .
Yeah , I &apos;m not worried about it now .
I &apos;ve recorded 44,000 young people .
And we were listening to everybody .
and working with NGOs and building this case .
I don &apos;t know how to get involved in that process .
And thank you to all of them .
That was an incredible moment .
And suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day .
It never happened .
And we have to make this day work .
It &apos;s just symbolism .
Children can lead their projects .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d heard .
And so I went back to the United Nations .
I decided that I &apos;d continue filming and make another movie .
And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years .
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan .
I won &apos;t go into that .
It &apos;d be really interesting if you came .
It would help and bring attention .
I think there &apos;s a number of pillars to success .
One is you &apos;ve got to have a great idea .
So these guys were absolutely crucial .
We had to wait now and see what happened .
We will observe this day .
We see it as a window of opportunity .
And we will not engage . We &apos;re not going to engage . &quot;
And we gave the film over .
Obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
They were saying they would stop .
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least .
And I was there thinking about what was going on .
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent .
We have to go for a global truce .
That &apos;s exactly what we must do .
And it &apos;s in the six official languages of the United Nations .
And you can see the education box there .
Ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
We &apos;ll utilize sport and football .
And ultimately , we have to try that .
We have to work together .
I was with Brahimi , Ambassador Brahimi .
He &apos;s an amazing man .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s absolutely possible . &quot;
I said , &quot; What would you do ?
Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system ? &quot;
He said , &quot; No , I &apos;d talk to the individuals . &quot;
It &apos;s all about the individuals .
It &apos;s all about you and me .
It &apos;s all about partnerships .
It &apos;s about your constituencies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
By working together , we can create peace one day .
Thank you TED . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks a lot .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
It was , the first two were , &quot; It &apos;s a ... &quot;
We don &apos;t say , &quot; It &apos;s a gay boy . &quot;
&quot; A lesbian girl . &quot;
I know you know a lot of endocrinology . &quot;
This wasn &apos;t rocket science .
And so he did .
Right ?
Does this make so-and-so straight ?
In other words , one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other .
And the data show it .
So what to do ?
And they fall apart .
That &apos;s how good it can be .
They look normal . They had normal heights .
in a crowd .
Well , where were these kids before ?
They were out there suffering , is where they were .
So we started a program in 2007 .
And since then , we have 160 patients .
Did they come from Afghanistan ? No .
And some came from England .
Jackie had been abused in the Midlands , in England .
It was a horror show .
They had to homeschool her .
And yet , she had just begun a male puberty .
And so here she is at 16 , on the left .
They will do it at 18 now .
The judges debated as to , can they do this ?
And she &apos;s become a remarkable spokeswoman .
Go figure .
So this picture , I think , says it all .
It really says it all .
He &apos;s got a prominent Adam &apos;s apple .
Now Nicole is on estrogen .
She has a bit of a form to her .
And then they finally got it .
So where do we go from here ?
Well , we still have a ways to go in terms of anti-discrimination .
We need less expensive drugs .
They cost a fortune .
This is not that common .
Thank you .
Coke is everywhere .
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
So why does this matter ?
So let &apos;s start with the data .
They have this very continuous feedback loop .
It &apos;s a lot like other consumer companies .
Let &apos;s contrast that for a minute to development .
Real-time data turns on the lights .
So what &apos;s the second thing that Coke &apos;s good at ?
Let &apos;s look at the development side .
So what &apos;s the next step for Ethiopia ?
Well , they &apos;re already starting talk about this .
The third component of Coke &apos;s success is marketing .
Well , it &apos;s aspirational .
Coke &apos;s global campaign slogan is &quot; Open Happiness . &quot;
But they localize it .
Now , that played itself out in the World Cup campaign .
So how does health and development market ?
Well , it &apos;s based on avoidance , not aspirations .
&quot; Use a condom , don &apos;t get AIDS . &quot;
&quot; Wash you hands , you might not get diarrhea . &quot;
It doesn &apos;t sound anything like &quot; Wavin &apos; Flag &quot; to me .
And I think that &apos;s a mistake .
One example is sanitation .
But there &apos;s a solution : you build a toilet .
They sometimes store grain in it .
Well , you work with the community .
I &apos;m not kidding .
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets .
No loo , no &quot; I do . &quot;
But more importantly , it saves lives .
They &apos;re waiting to be circumcised .
Can you you believe that ?
Well , why is all of this so important ?
In 2009 , we &apos;re down to 1,600 cases .
Well how did that happen ?
Let &apos;s look at a country like India .
They have two and a half million vaccinators .
Now it could have come from one of two places .
So many more people would have been affected .
So what &apos;s the endgame ?
It &apos;s not the marketing on the ground .
And we are so close .
And this victory is so possible .
To me , that is deep happiness .
Thank you .
JoAnn Kuchera-Morin : Stunning data visualization in the AlloSphere
This first project is called the AlloBrain .
You &apos;re flying through the cortex of my colleague &apos;s brain .
They &apos;re mining blood density levels .
And they &apos;re reporting them back to you sonically .
You view the bond in the triangle .
This is actually a light emitter .
And they &apos;re understanding more about quantum mathematics .
You &apos;re actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow .
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere .
Thank you very much .
Ben Saunders : Why bother leaving the house ?
The pithiest answer to the question &quot; why ? &quot;
We don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
There was a bit of fun , a bit of joy .
And that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
So again , there wasn &apos;t an awful lot of joy or fun to be had .
And I would add a cautionary note here , however .
Many of you will know the story .
We have to turn around and come back again .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m a process engineer .
This is an inherited disorder .
I was already up at 4.4 .
The thought of the surgery was not attractive .
The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
I can do this . I can change this .
The project aim is really quite simple .
And it would remain stable and operate quite happily .
So where do we start ?
Well this is a sagittal slice through me .
This is a model of my aorta .
You can see , it &apos;s quite a complex structure .
So it &apos;s quite a difficult structure to produce .
Happy , away I went .
Four and a half hours on the table and everything was done .
So the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part .
No breaking into your circulatory system .
So it really is great .
Well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
This is a list of the core team .
Jargon is a big one .
Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well .
In the medical world they look up at plans .
So the horizontal images were all an inversion .
So one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in Poland .
And they made extra problems for us .
In the U.K. we have the National Institute for Clinical Excellence , NICE .
We had to get past the NICE problem .
I &apos;ve coined a phrase &quot; obstructive conservatism . &quot;
They don &apos;t want to change .
And in fact , there are many surgeons in the U.K.
We &apos;ve actually got 30 patients .
I &apos;m at seven and a half years .
You &apos;ve got to express support for them .
Tom Treasure , professor of cardiothoracic surgery : incredible guy .
Dead easy to give him respect .
Him giving me respect ? Slightly different .
That &apos;s all the bad news .
The good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge .
Translate that one . I bet they can &apos;t .
So Heather &apos;s going to like me .
It would be a pleasure to speak with you . Many thanks .
Mark Bittman : What &apos;s wrong with what we eat
I write about food . I write about cooking .
Now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic .
And why do I say it ?
There was the bomb , and there &apos;s now .
Then hear this , please .
There &apos;s more .
Now global warming was unforeseen .
It &apos;s not the beta-carotene , it &apos;s the carrot .
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health .
This evidence is overwhelming at this point .
Not bad .
But back to animals and junk food .
What do they have in common ?
One : we don &apos;t need either of them for health .
We &apos;re not born craving Whoppers or Skittles .
Now , let &apos;s imagine a parallel .
Incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
Yet they do that .
And guess what ?
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
That &apos;s our number . 10 billion .
That &apos;s just the United States .
Seriously .
They both get it wrong , though .
A hundred years ago , guess what ?
Every family had a cook , usually a mom .
And those moms bought and prepared food .
It was like your romantic vision of Europe .
Margarine didn &apos;t exist .
There were no restaurant chains .
You just ate .
You didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
There was no marketing . There were no national brands .
Vitamins had not been invented .
You ate food .
The cornflake hadn &apos;t been invented .
Goldfish swam .
And again , everyone ate local .
Oranges became common in New York .
Thus arrived convenience .
Who needed it though ? Meat was everywhere .
New drugs kept them healthy .
Well , they kept them alive .
Healthy was another story .
And chicken soon joined them on the throne .
Meat consumption increased five-fold .
And this took care of the situation resoundingly .
Not that they were any good , but they were there .
For dessert , store-bought ice cream or cookies .
It wasn &apos;t all bad .
We weren &apos;t all hippies , either .
Many people became fat-phobic .
Others worshiped broccoli , as if it were God-like .
But mostly they didn &apos;t eat broccoli .
Similarly , let &apos;s look at a granola bar .
Think of the frozen chicken nugget .
And zapped horribly , pathetically .
Leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
So , now we clamor for organic food .
That &apos;s good .
Let me pose you a question .
I don &apos;t know .
Now here is where we all meet .
We need to start acting .
How much livestock do you need to produce this ?
What do you think we eat per day ? Half a pound .
Isn &apos;t meat eating essential to health ?
Some of us might think that would be a good thing .
Ann Cooper &apos;s right .
And that happens to be quite easy .
Less meat , less junk , more plants .
It &apos;s a simple formula : eat food .
Eat real food .
We have to choose that path .
Thank you .
David Hanson : Robots that &quot; show emotion &quot;
There he &apos;s starting to walk .
And here is a little bit of the technology that &apos;s involved in that .
Okay . So I &apos;m smiling .
Now I &apos;m frowning .
And this is really heavily backlit .
Okay , here we go .
Oh , it &apos;s so sad .
Okay , so you smile , frowning .
Those machines have no place for empathy .
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
So , we &apos;re involving two things .
which was the basis of the movie &quot; Bladerunner . &quot;
And we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
Thank you so much . That &apos;s incredible .
We &apos;re not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
It &apos;s a six-day immersive experience for the kids .
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
We start from doodles and sketches .
And sometimes we make real plans .
And sometimes we just start building .
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear .
All materials are available for use .
Three , two , one , go !
Yay !
GT : Thank you . It &apos;s been a great pleasure .
Marco Tempest : Augmented reality , techno-magic
So magic is a very introverted field .
That &apos;s true even amongst peers .
Could we bring down the lights please ? Thank you .
So let &apos;s give this a try .
Terribly sorry . I forgot the floor .
Wake up .
Hey .
Come on .
Please .
Come on .
Ah , sorry about that .
Forgot this .
Give it another try .
Okay .
He figured out the system .
Uh oh .
All right . Let &apos;s try this .
Come on .
Hey .
You heard her , go ahead .
Bye-bye .
Thank you .
Majora Carter : Greening the ghetto
We garnered much support along the way .
These impacts are coming everyone &apos;s way .
Good .
These things make me different from you .
So how did things get so different for us ?
My dad was not alone .
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems .
600,000 people were displaced .
Now , why is this story important ?
Even during rush hour , it goes virtually unused .
So -- -- so cool !
I like that , too .
It &apos;s better to ask for forgiveness than permission .
At present , that &apos;s not happening in New York City .
This is my version of globalization .
He looked at the demographics .
For his brilliant efforts , he was nearly impeached .
We have no excuse in this country . I &apos;m sorry .
But Bogota &apos;s example has the power to change that .
You , however , are blessed with the gift of influence .
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice .
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return .
His response was a grant program .
I was making him an offer .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong , we need money .
Ciao bellos !
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag .
Actually our body doesn &apos;t hate these .
I mean , the cells in our immune system are always hungry .
And I said , why don &apos;t you use that ?
Our antibiotics are running out .
And I feel now like George Bush .
It &apos;s like &quot; mission accomplished . &quot;
And it &apos;s killing bacteria . It &apos;s eating them .
Why did they not die ?
So we did it . Okay ?
Mission accomplished !
Hans Rosling : Global population growth , box by box
This box contains one billion people .
And they lived away then .
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes .
Just look how many .
And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the West .
So this is where they are today .
They are now buying cars .
So there they are .
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 .
They will start flying .
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
The year is 1960 .
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
Look , Bangladesh catching up with India .
They are still up here .
Child survival is the new green .
And will it happen ?
I &apos;m a very serious &quot; possibilist . &quot;
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
And look at the position of the old West .
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Thank you very much .
Joe Sabia : The technology of storytelling
Ladies and gentlemen , gather around .
I would love to share with you a story .
Now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling .
It was venerable .
It was ubiquitous .
But it was a little bit boring .
His name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer .
He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors .
And this was a cause for celebration .
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
And for the most part , the stories are recycled .
Jeff Smith : Lessons in business ... from prison
For the most part , everyone was just trying to survive .
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reasons .
So how do you survive ?
There &apos;s legal hustles .
You want a dirty magazine ?
Well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars .
Thank you .
Come on , raise your hands .
How many of you are checking it right now ?
Credit card , investment account ?
How about this week ?
Now , how about your household energy use ?
This week ? Last week ?
A few energy geeks spread out across the room .
It &apos;s good to see you guys .
In fact , only 10 percent ends up as light .
So this coal will last a little bit more than a month .
Turn off your air conditioning , turn on your fans .
In fact , it already is .
And it &apos;s working .
And we &apos;re not burning anything .
So what are we waiting for ?
Take a look at the Prius .
Which brings us back to Harriet .
We met her on our first family vacation .
It was then that her eyes lit up .
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet &apos;s question .
Thank you .
Miwa Matreyek : Glorious visions in animation and performance
Miwa Matreyek !
Ami Klin : A new way to diagnose autism
We intuit other people &apos;s feelings .
We do that all the time . We just can &apos;t shake it off .
We are social to the core .
And for them , autism was devastating .
They had profound intellectual disabilities .
Extremely , extremely isolated .
These are survival skills .
They orient to the caregiver .
Well , they orient to the caregiver .
The caregiver seeks the baby .
You &apos;d do probably two things , wouldn &apos;t you ?
You would recoil . You would call the police .
We do so , remember , intuitively , effortlessly .
It &apos;s a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born .
There are those individuals who don &apos;t talk at all .
There are those individuals who talk too much .
Well , this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time .
Well , now we know it &apos;s more like one in 100 .
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
The societal cost of this condition is huge .
It &apos;s not that that window closes . It doesn &apos;t .
But it diminishes considerably .
So this is our view of autism .
Autism creates itself .
So how do we do that ?
We had to see the world through her eyes .
You &apos;re watching a video .
What are the children with autism doing ?
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months .
It &apos;s something very different .
And the idea is not to cure autism .
That &apos;s not the idea .
We want them to be free of that .
Well thank you for listening to me .
Alan Siegel : Let &apos;s simplify legal jargon !
This is a real thing .
But it &apos;s going to work . It &apos;s more effective than just computational aids .
And what about terms like &quot; over the limit &quot; ?
Perhaps a stealth thing .
Plain English is about changing the content .
It &apos;s a grid , it &apos;s a calendar .
Received very favorably by business .
And there is some good news to report today .
There are 200 million letters that go out .
They have been tested in the laboratory .
And the IRS has introduced the program .
We see all this complexity .
So , how are we going to change the world ?
Make clarity , transparency and simplicity a national priority .
I thank you .
Back in 1957 , there was a Spencer Tracy , Katharine Hepburn movie .
And they would look that up .
And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job .
But that &apos;s not what happened in fact .
Same thing happened in offices .
Back in the old days , people used spreadsheets .
But here was an interesting thing that came along .
It increased their capabilities .
On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot .
So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs .
These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.
They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen .
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
And ordinary people can &apos;t interact with them .
It &apos;s displaced the worker from the technology .
So Baxter is up here .
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics .
We &apos;ve got a conveyor there .
It &apos;s going to come bring it over here and put it down .
The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense .
The eyes are on the screen there .
It &apos;s got a little bit of basic common sense , goes and picks the objects .
And Baxter &apos;s safe to interact with .
But with Baxter it doesn &apos;t hurt .
It puts a little icon there .
He didn &apos;t have to select that from a menu .
These robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
They go to factories around the country .
This is Mildred .
Mildred &apos;s a factory worker in Connecticut .
She &apos;s worked on the line for over 20 years .
She decided she really liked robots .
Now she &apos;s got the robot doing it .
There aren &apos;t many young people coming into factory work .
That &apos;s climate change and demographics .
Demographics is really going to change our world .
That &apos;s happening statistically right now .
Getting the groceries in from the car , up the stairs , into the kitchen .
Thanks very much .
Marco Tempest : A magical tale
Today &apos;s its debut .
It &apos;s a demonstration of augmented reality .
So fingers crossed .
And keep your eyes on the big screen .
Augmented reality is just the latest technology .
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief .
Without this ability there is no magic .
Jean Robert-Houdin : A conjurer is not a juggler .
He is an actor playing the part of a magician .
Now many of them are intensely dramatic .
Because the best stories always have a happy ending .
The tricks of magic have one special element .
They are stories with a twist .
MT : In that respect , magic tricks are like jokes .
Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination .
The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks .
It &apos;s fun to be fooled .
We feel compelled to tell them .
They want to share the experience .
It keeps me busy .
We think in narrative structures .
It &apos;s a uniquely human achievement .
They give us our identity and a sense of community .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hi .
I did that for two reasons .
I &apos;m used to a stationary mic .
It &apos;s the sensible shoe of public address .
I just become skanky .
So I &apos;m sorry about that .
And I &apos;m already off-message .
Because that is what Knopf is .
We bring stories to the public .
They all need a face .
But you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
Because this is treating your audience like a moron .
And they deserve better .
So there you are .
Pure content and pure form , side by side .
No fighting , ladies .
Genius !
We &apos;re in the middle of the process .
And then I just threw some typography on it .
Very basic stuff , slightly suggestive of public park signage .
I miss Michael .
Well , they used it .
And I was thrilled .
No , that is not me .
I was so wasted . &quot;
That &apos;s a responsibility .
You get something that goes much deeper than that .
Hello !
What does that mean ?
Very simple stuff .
Now , that &apos;s a good printing job .
A book cover is a distillation .
It is a haiku , if you will , of the story .
This story was a real puzzle .
This is what it &apos;s about .
And so , here &apos;s the design , right ?
Huhh ! They &apos;ve been discovered by the sultan .
He will not be pleased .
Huhh ! And now the sultan is in danger .
Try experiencing that on a Kindle .
Don &apos;t get me started .
Seriously .
Much is to be gained by eBooks : ease , convenience , portability .
He &apos;d smell it .
So how do we show this ?
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum .
It &apos;s one part of the form and content .
Not exactly Jackie Collins .
So that &apos;s my story . To be continued .
What does it look like ?
Thank you .
And it is .
And yet , it feels natural to us now .
At the time , we knew that it was political .
Aicha el-Wafi : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .
So they introduced me to five families .
And I saw Phyllis , and I watched her .
She was the only mother in the group .
The others were brothers , sisters .
I was married when I was 14 .
So the story with Zacarias was too much really .
I know she really cried for her son .
I talk against violence , against terrorism .
But we were all so nervous .
&quot; Why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
And then she was nervous .
&quot; Why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
Because our time is up .
You must be tolerant .
You have to fight against violence .
This is what I wanted to say .
Graham Hill : Why I &apos;m a weekday vegetarian
I also knew that I &apos;m not alone .
So why was I stalling ?
Imagine your last hamburger .
Sound familiar ?
It &apos;s called weekday veg .
On the weekend , your choice .
Simple .
The program has been great , weekday veg .
Thank you .
Taryn Simon : Photographs of secret sites
Photography threatens fantasy .
So I create these two poles .
This process costs 60,000 dollars .
I do take certain liberties and intervene .
It &apos;s a research crop marijuana grow room .
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine .
And Playboy is always in the top few .
Meaning white fur , ice blue eyes , a pink nose .
It &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
Kenny was born . He actually made it to adulthood .
This is the Death Star .
They flip the negative .
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky .
It &apos;s a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site .
It &apos;s called the World Church of God .
It &apos;s supposed to be a generic site of worship .
And I put them into my photograph .
It runs 24 hours a day , commercial free .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Innocents . &quot;
I &apos;ll give you an example from a case .
The scene of arrest , the scene of misidentification , the alibi location .
He is photographed at his alibi location .
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia .
That &apos;s it . Thank you .
Ed Boyden : A light switch for neurons
Think about your day for a second .
Let &apos;s make it concrete .
It &apos;s called the basket cell .
New ones are being discovered everyday .
They &apos;re excitatory .
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins .
So this is very powerful .
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics .
And so that &apos;s what happens .
And he &apos;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
Now we can generalize the idea .
This goes back to the Pavlovian days .
Okay , there it goes . Right now .
And the retina , of course , is a complex structure .
Now how could you repair this ?
On the other hand , light can still get into the eye .
So this is some work that we &apos;re doing .
Light is converted to electricity on them .
Thank you .
Juan Enriquez : So some of the stuff is a little dense .
Ed Boyden : That &apos;s right .
Right , yeah .
Well that &apos;s something we &apos;re starting to work on very hard .
Ueli Gegenschatz : Extreme wingsuit flying
I started with paragliding .
From there I started with skydiving .
From regular , relative skydiving I went on to freeflying .
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving .
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing .
From there I went on to wingsuit flying .
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side .
You need to have the best possible equipment .
So for 2009 , I &apos;m training hard for my two new projects .
Enjoy , and thank you very much .
I have some questions .
I think we all might have some questions .
Because it looks like it might .
UE : It &apos;s a dream . It &apos;s a dream . Yeah .
And I believe soon .
All right . Well we will watch this space . But I have two more questions .
UE : Nope . It &apos;s just smoke .
Coming off of you ?
UE : Hopefully not .
That seems dangerous .
What do you do to to cover your face ?
And is that how you usually fly ?
So you have to be prepared .
and do you ever say , &quot; No , no I &apos;m not going to . &quot;
UE : Thank you very much .
Amanda Palmer : The art of asking
So I didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
Hello .
And I would get harassed sometimes .
&quot; Get a job ! &quot;
It was consistent .
This was me on piano , a genius drummer .
This is a library in Auckland .
Is this fair ?
And I thought , this is fair .
This is this .
Is this what stupid people do ?
Is this how stupid people die ?
We signed with a major label .
It &apos;s not for everybody .
Well , maybe it &apos;s for you .
And they walk off .
I just want you to have this money . &quot;
And this starts happening all the time .
Thank you .
And the goal was 100,000 dollars .
And you can see how many people it is .
It &apos;s about 25,000 people .
It &apos;s kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists .
They don &apos;t want to ask for things .
And a lot of artists have a problem with this .
Asking makes you vulnerable .
And this hurt in a really familiar way .
Should I ? Show me .
I see them as trust .
Thank you .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
And it &apos;s a pretty big building .
Maybe it &apos;s better to imagine it as a comparison .
This is five times larger .
Right ? It &apos;s pretty big .
And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone .
In fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners .
Right ?
Now we know for a fact it &apos;s happening .
We didn &apos;t know about DoubleArrow .
But now we do .
So that &apos;s basically perfectly safe , uncrackable .
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind .
So what do we actually know about the leaks ?
And every single one of these companies denies .
Yet we have these files .
Instead , they &apos;ve been hacked .
And there &apos;s more evidence supporting this theory as well .
What the hell ?
All countries spy .
And maybe that &apos;s true .
Let &apos;s take , for example , Sweden .
And then we turn it around .
And the answer is zero .
So this is not balanced .
Like , Skype used to be secure .
It used to be end-to-end encrypted .
Then it was sold to the United States .
Today , it no longer is secure .
It &apos;s the war on terror .
You shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
Well , it &apos;s not the war on terror .
It &apos;s not the war on terror .
Feel free to survey me if that helps .
And I have nothing to hide .
I &apos;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
Because that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . It &apos;s about privacy .
Privacy is nonnegotiable .
We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families .
And surveillance changes history .
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
Privacy is the building block of our democracies .
So Mr. Snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things .
So , what is there to be done ?
Should we worry . No , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
But that &apos;s not going to really change the situation .
And that &apos;s much easier said than done .
How do you do that ?
But maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
Maybe you can do it together with other countries .
The solution is open source .
It only has to solve one little problem .
Thank you very much .
Charlie Todd : The shared experience of absurdity
Now this took place in January of 2002 .
She doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
She &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
This is on the 6 train in New York City .
And this is the first stop along the line .
And that &apos;s me right there in a brown coat .
It &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
I &apos;m wearing a hat . I &apos;m wearing a scarf .
And the girl &apos;s going to notice me right here .
One person &apos;s not that unusual .
They &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
We &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings .
So the video won &apos;t show everything .
This goes on for another four stops .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
And I love that girl &apos;s reaction so much .
And we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
So I could do more large-scale projects .
So I got inspired by that .
This was completely unauthorized .
We didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
And I stood in the park giving signals .
The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together .
You &apos;ll see that start right here .
And then we had dancing . We had everyone dance .
There were several other activities .
So here &apos;s the video .
So again , this is 2005 .
This is the Best Buy in New York City .
There was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
So a very diverse group of people .
And I told people , &quot; Don &apos;t work . Don &apos;t actually do work .
But also , don &apos;t shop .
Everybody else is one of our actors .
The lower level employees thought it was very funny .
You can see them in this footage .
They &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
Thank you .
And one morning , I was riding the subway .
So this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8 : 30 in the morning .
It &apos;s morning rush hour .
It &apos;s very cold outside .
Thank you .
And of course they don &apos;t .
It &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
We don &apos;t need a reason .
Thank you very much .
In my previous life , I was an artist .
I still paint . I love art .
For 11 years , I was mayor of Tirana , our capital .
We faced many challenges .
He screeched that he would block the financing .
&quot; But why ? &quot; I asked him .
So it &apos;s time for change .
What are colors doing to us ? &quot;
To the first question , 63 percent of people said yes , we like it .
Thirty-seven said no , we don &apos;t like it .
So we noticed change .
&quot; Well , because the street is safer now , &quot; they answered .
&quot; Come on , man ! What policemen ?
And this was not a misplaced feeling .
Crime did fall .
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets .
They were paying in order to skip the queue , the long queue .
It &apos;s not about genes .
It &apos;s about system , it &apos;s about organization .
It &apos;s also about environment and respect .
We removed the kiosks .
I tweet . I love it .
Politics is not just about leaders .
It &apos;s not just about politicians and laws .
Our world is defined by the pace of change .
We can all change the world .
Efharisto and kalinihta .
Dan Meyer : Math class needs a makeover
I teach high school math .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
Students lack perseverance .
This is really destructive .
It applies equally to math .
I believe in real life .
So I hope you can see .
The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
And here &apos;s how it works .
The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
So now we have a water tank .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
It &apos;s tedious .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
This has been a lot of fun .
Math makes sense of the world .
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
Nellie McKay : &quot; Mother of Pearl , &quot; &quot; If I Had You &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
That &apos;s Europe . &quot; But , yeah .
They are more dynamic .
This monster with big tentacles .
They &apos;re very explicit in these editorials .
Fund the infrastructure . Fund the schools .
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries . &quot;
Those colorful , out-of-the-box kind of thinkers .
GPS was funded by the military &apos;s Navstar program .
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA .
They do . They spend on the marketing part .
It was actually shaping and creating markets .
It was even , God forbid , being a venture capitalist .
Who &apos;s actually funding the hard stuff ?
Of course , it &apos;s not just the state .
The private sector does a lot .
And so there &apos;s huge implications of this .
It &apos;s actually been the one thinking out of the box .
That whole juxtaposition thing , it &apos;s kind of there .
You will fail when you innovative .
One out of 10 experiments has any success .
The Internet was crazy .
Well , unfortunately , that &apos;s not true .
I mean , one can take a position on that .
It could happen perhaps through equity .
Thank you .
Jennifer 8 . Lee : The hunt for General Tso
What is this ?
Should I try it ?
Try it !
What is it called ?
Fortune cookie .
There &apos;s a piece of paper inside !
What is this ?
You &apos;ve won a prize !
What is this ?
It &apos;s a fortune !
Tasty !
So , where are they from ?
The short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from Japan .
So , how did they get to the United States ?
They are more American than anything else .
I love this dish .
He &apos;s in Taiwan right now .
I went to his home town .
And I went looking for chicken .
Believe it or not , these guys were actually crossing the road .
And then they &apos;re like , is this Chinese food ?
Because it doesn &apos;t look like Chinese food to them .
She &apos;s like , &quot; It &apos;s not ?
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered .
But you know what ?
It wasn &apos;t that .
Yeah . So , I went and started looking .
So , a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets .
And this logo !
So . Thank you very much .
Dong Woo Jang : The art of bow-making
Why bows ?
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Airport security .
I also researched extensively on bows around the world .
The most effective bow for me would be like this .
And four : Horn used to store energy in compression .
Through bowmaking , I came in contact with part of my heritage .
And let &apos;s see how this one works .
You need to console and communicate with the wood material .
Now , I am shooting a part of myself to you .
Did it strike you ?
Thank you .
Erin McKean : The joy of lexicography
How about this word ?
Here , I &apos;ll show it to you .
Lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
Notice -- we &apos;re very specific -- that word &quot; compile . &quot;
And those bits are words .
But the thing is , I don &apos;t want to be a traffic cop .
For one thing , I just do not do uniforms .
Well , I blame the Queen .
Why do I blame the Queen ?
James Murray , first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary .
And of course , a few of us are saying : okay , computers !
Computers ! What about computers ?
The thing about computers is , I love computers .
They don &apos;t change the end result .
The design has not changed .
And OK , what about online dictionaries , right ?
Online dictionaries must be different .
This is my favorite word , by the way .
Very useful word . So , look at that .
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
Does everyone know the ham butt problem ?
She thought , &quot; Well , my mom always did this . &quot;
We have a pan that &apos;s too small !
The English language is as big as it is .
Some of my best friends are books .
Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; Oh , boy .
No . There will still be paper dictionaries .
And I think this is a problem .
Lexicography is really more about material science .
They &apos;re just the right tools for the job .
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
If you love a word , it becomes real .
You can ask for help !
That &apos;s 500,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot .
There &apos;s a lot going on there .
Tiny , little word , 33 numbered definitions .
Do you know what that says to me ?
I mean , lexicography is not rocket science .
And we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
We &apos;re missing California from American English .
We don &apos;t even see that there &apos;s a gap on the map .
It can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
He &apos;s a director of an electroplating company .
He &apos;s found more than 140 comets .
It &apos;s kind of out past Mars . It &apos;s a hike .
Where did it come from ? Who said it ?
What newspaper was it in ? What book ?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact .
It dies too fast .
They use it synecdochically .
We can put in all the meanings .
This is what dictionaries used to look like .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
Thank you very much for your kind attention .
Angela Belcher : Using nature to grow batteries
I brought along with me an abalone shell .
Yet , it &apos;s 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart .
So that &apos;s the vision that I &apos;ve been thinking about .
There are natural biological materials .
These proteins are very negatively charged .
And so here &apos;s the periodic table .
And I absolutely love the periodic table .
And that &apos;s a hard sell to a graduate student .
&quot; I have this great project -- 50 million years . &quot;
And this is pretty easy biotechnology .
And then it wires itself to the current collector .
I brought it here .
You can make lots of amplifications to it .
We &apos;re able to do this also with catalysis .
And I brought an example with me of that today .
These are virus-assembled nanowires .
The last example are solar cells .
You can also do this with solar cells .
Thank you .
Stefan Sagmeister : Happiness by design
And at the time I was very superstitious .
So there are , of course , two different possibilities .
This is 1983 .
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness .
While , somewhat , the Spaniards ...
and , I think , particularly , the Swiss , don &apos;t seem to be doing all that well .
And their inaugural exhibit was called &quot; Happiness . &quot;
Under &quot; Nirvana &quot; they showed this Constable painting .
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction .
This is , you know , a book .
It &apos;s a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne .
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face .
You know , that &apos;s not a big deal to accomplish .
This is , you know , the movie poster .
True printed his own version of these signs .
So this is one .
Now , True is a real humanitarian .
Another New York project .
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day .
You don &apos;t see the horizon .
And the room is truly something to be seen .
He &apos;s from Korea originally .
And other people go and fill them in .
This one says , &quot; Please let me die in peace . &quot;
You know , one is : just working without pressure .
Then : working concentrated , without being frazzled .
This is , you know , related to it : getting out of the studio .
And being able to enjoy the end results .
And the whole thing just fell together .
Again , we could supply the content for it .
So I just picked another one .
And this was two weeks ago .
And then we did one more of these .
This is , again , for a magazine , dividing pages .
This is from the front .
Then it &apos;s : &quot; always works out . &quot;
Then it &apos;s &quot; for , &quot; with the light on .
And it &apos;s &quot; me . &quot;
Thank you so much .
And I want to tell you that story .
Craig Venter chairs that event .
And he said , on the spot , &quot; Absolutely , yes . &quot;
You do it again and again .
We set out to do this .
It took us 11 years to become operational .
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking .
And he wanted to go .
And six months later , we sat down at Kennedy Space Center .
And what he said , for me , was very moving .
A few TEDsters here .
We set up a whole ER .
So we did a second parabola .
And a third .
And we did a fourth , and a fifth and a sixth .
And a seventh and an eighth .
He was so happy .
Please join us in this epic adventure .
Thank you so much .
Matt Killingsworth : Want to be happier ? Stay in the moment
So what did we find ?
It &apos;s amazing .
Ten percent of the time people &apos;s minds are wandering when they &apos;re having sex .
Thank you .
Eli Beer : The fastest ambulance ? A motorcycle
This is an ambucycle .
You see the defibrillator . You see the equipment .
We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston .
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem .
We were passing by a bus stop .
The bus was on fire , and many people were hurt and killed .
He just needed someone helping him .
We were so scared and we just ran away .
The traffic is so bad . The distance , and everything .
He could have run from a block away .
He could have saved this child .
I said to myself , there must be a better way .
Just alert us by beeper .
I was a very stubborn kid .
He was on Coumadin .
He was bleeding from his neck .
So today , 22 years later , we have United Hatzalah .
I forgot I &apos;m not in Israel .
The reasons why we &apos;re so successful are because of three things .
We &apos;re not there to replace ambulances .
The second reason is because of our technology .
You know , Israelis are good in technology .
And the third thing are these ambucycles .
That &apos;s why we get there so fast .
They ask me to meet . They wanted to meet with me .
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan .
Something special happened .
And these are all volunteers .
No one is getting money .
They &apos;re all doing it for the purpose of saving lives .
And he saved my father .
When I started this organization , I was 17 years old .
I never even knew what TEDMED was then .
But it could spread everywhere .
It &apos;s very easy to adopt .
And we made a difference .
We all want to be heroes .
Thank you very much .
Joshua Silver : Adjustable liquid-filled eyeglasses
I &apos;d like to start with a little experiment .
They also have an estimate of around a billion .
There are just way too few eye care professionals .
How do you do this ? How do you solve this problem ?
Next step in my process .
... I &apos;ve just ...
Now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .
In fact , this technology &apos;s been evolving .
There are about 30,000 in use now .
And they &apos;re in fifteen countries . They &apos;re spread around the world .
I have a global vision for vision .
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology .
This pair , in fact , these currently cost about 19 dollars .
But the cost has to be brought right down .
How do you solve this problem ?
You start to get into detail .
How do you deal with the industry ?
And the answer to that is research .
Julia Bacha : Pay attention to nonviolence
I &apos;m a filmmaker .
Why aren &apos;t Palestinians using nonviolent resistance ?
Yet , most of you have probably never heard about them .
But I think the girls could do it .
Chanting : One united nation .
Fatah , Hamas and the Popular Front !
News Anchor : The clashes over the fence continue .
They were allowed to use any force necessary .
These are live bullets .
It &apos;s like Fallujah . Shooting everywhere .
Protester : This is a peaceful march .
There is no need to use violence .
Chanting : We can do it ! We can do it !
We can do it !
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories .
But that &apos;s true for adults too .
So we organized a screening .
So they kept on going .
Thank you .
Seth Godin : How to get your ideas to spread
I call it the &quot; TV-industrial complex . &quot;
Now there are magazines about water .
Cows are invisible . Cows are boring .
I could do that again if you want it .
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going .
Because it &apos;s new , because it &apos;s fresh .
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way .
It wasn &apos;t what they expected .
That &apos;s what mass marketing is .
It was all about going for the center .
But market to these people because they care .
These are the people who are obsessed with something .
It &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out .
Pearl Jam , 96 albums released in the last two years .
Every one made a profit . How ?
They only sell them on their website .
And one person at a time , the idea spreads .
These are not diamonds , not really .
They &apos;re made from &quot; cremains . &quot;
After you &apos;re cremated you can have yourself made into a gem .
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .
A couple of quick rules to wrap up .
Proctor and Gamble knows this , right ?
Very good is boring . Very good is average .
So my three stories .
Sales tripled . Why ?
Milk , milk , milk , milk , milk -- not milk .
For the people who were there and looking at that section , it was remarkable .
Because he did something that was at the fringes .
People with 20,000-dollar stereos don &apos;t like new music .
So what you need to do is figure out who does care .
The last example I want to give you .
This is a map of Soap Lake , Washington .
But they do have a lake .
Thank you very much for your attention .
Rob Hopkins : Transition to a world without oil
Like all stories , it has a beginning .
This is a liter of oil .
And that gap continues to widen .
Completely unprecedented , historically .
Already that &apos;s fallen to about 11 .
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world .
There is the story of &quot; The Elves and the Shoemaker . &quot;
It &apos;s something that was unimaginable to people then .
But we don &apos;t appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been .
This is a popular story in some places .
But the world isn &apos;t Second Life .
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative .
Energy and technology are not the same thing .
What I &apos;m involved with is the transition response .
And it is something which has several characteristics .
It &apos;s viral . It seems to spread under the radar very , very quickly .
It &apos;s sensitive to place and to scale .
Transitional is completely different .
It learns very much from its mistakes .
And it &apos;s a process which is really joyful .
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology .
So how does this transition idea work ?
There are now over 200 formal transition projects .
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff .
A lot of places are working with their local schools .
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies .
And that &apos;s certainly been my experience with transition .
And we see it all over the place as well now .
Because I think stories are vital here .
I &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky , we &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky .
Thank you very much .
&quot; People do stupid things .
That &apos;s what spreads HIV . &quot;
Well , one or two brave souls .
Wonderful .
It &apos;s getting blunter and blunter .
&quot; Oh yeah , by sharing needles . &quot;
&quot; Oh yeah . &quot; Hundred percent .
&quot; Are you carrying clean needles ? &quot;
One in four , maximum .
There &apos;s just kind of an ick factor there .
And that changes the equation slightly , doesn &apos;t it ?
So , suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles .
This is a really easy problem .
For once , your incentives are aligned .
We &apos;ve got what &apos;s rational for public health .
There is nothing on the other side .
So , completely irrational , you would think .
Now let &apos;s talk about sex .
Are we any more rational about sex ?
It &apos;s not that easy !
Here , maybe you &apos;ll have better luck .
No one wants it .
He &apos;s from Haiti and he has AIDS .
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect .
Let &apos;s just stop treating people . &quot;
Of course not , of course not .
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can .
So these are data from Scotland .
Then it came way down .
This is of new infections .
What does that mean ?
What does it mean ?
Is that what &apos;s happening ?
No , and I call it the &quot; compassion conundrum . &quot;
Why does she do that job ?
It varies a bit province to province .
Okay , Ines .
Ines : So why is prevalence still rising ?
It &apos;s all politics .
When you get to politics , nothing makes sense .
But here &apos;s the thing : we are the voters .
Thank you .
Ellen Dunham-Jones : Retrofitting suburbia
So why is this important ?
And then there &apos;s finally -- there &apos;s the affordability question .
I mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures .
But is it practical ?
I think it is .
We just haven &apos;t caught up with the actual realities of this .
They &apos;re the other big generation .
It no longer just makes sense .
It turns out , all sorts of things .
It &apos;s keeping the lights on .
It &apos;s becoming , I think , a really great institution .
So , you know , sometimes it &apos;s incremental .
Sometimes , it &apos;s all at once .
So here &apos;s what it looks like .
This one is one of my favorites , Belmar .
Here was the mall in its heyday .
So here &apos;s the site in 1975 with the mall .
By 1995 , the mall has died .
They &apos;re easy to be re-adapted .
But the one story stuff ...
that &apos;s really history .
So here it is at projected build-out .
It &apos;s about two-thirds built out right now .
Here &apos;s what the new Main Street looks like .
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California .
But densification is not going to work everywhere .
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer .
This is another re-greening example .
It also makes sense in very strong markets .
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot .
What &apos;s next ?
I think we have three challenges for the future .
We need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened .
Where should we be redeveloping ?
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation ?
It &apos;s a little extreme , but we &apos;ve got a little water problem .
I have to say , these are very hybrid places .
But we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better .
The final challenge is for all of you .
Thank you .
Mitchell Besser : Mothers helping mothers fight HIV
I want you to take a trip with me .
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV .
The reality is really , very different .
It &apos;s an entire package of services , and it works .
What does that mean ?
And where do they come from ?
Well , less than one comes from the United States .
One , on average , comes from Europe .
100 come from Asia and the Pacific .
And let &apos;s look at another map .
And it &apos;s the same with nurses .
It &apos;s not possible -- it doesn &apos;t work .
Meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
And I want to change the story a little bit .
Have a seat . You &apos;re safe here .
We &apos;re all HIV-positive .
You &apos;re going to be okay . You &apos;re going to live .
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative . &quot;
So often the men are gone .
Now , doctors and nurses -- they too get trained .
Our organization has three goals .
The first , to prevent mother-to-child transmission .
So how do we do it ?
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .
Disclosure is so central to prevention .
We also work in groups .
And it &apos;s important about disclosure .
And everybody was quiet .
I &apos;m HIV-positive .
I &apos;ve been afraid to tell everybody . &quot;
And you see where this is going .
I thought you were going to hate me . &quot;
I am proof that there is hope .
Our organization works on three levels .
They become leaders within their communities .
We have to do that .
Our health care systems are broken .
They &apos;re not going to work the way they &apos;re currently designed .
What &apos;s extraordinary is how simple the premise is .
Past patients taking care of present patients .
Each person must know their HIV status .
Those who are HIV-negative must know how to stay negative .
MB : Simple solutions to complex problems .
Mothers caring for mothers .
It &apos;s transformational .
Thank you .
Jenna McCarthy : What you don &apos;t know about marriage
He buys a ring , she buys a dress .
They go shopping for all sorts of things .
And the big day comes .
Of course , the other half won &apos;t , right ?
And researchers want to know why .
What are they doing right ?
What can we learn from them ?
Obvious , right .
For example , the happy wife .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
Here &apos;s an interesting one .
Oh no .
Do not win an Oscar for best actress .
I &apos;m serious .
They actually call it the Oscar curse .
Drinking alcohol , it seems , is bad for your marriage .
Yeah .
We &apos;re healthier , physically and emotionally .
So we have to keep an eye on that .
And we do like a cocktail or two .
On the other hand , I have the fake happy picture thing .
So I &apos;ve got all those things going for me .
I &apos;ll see you at the bar .
And he kind of nodded , you know ?
And that always stuck with me all my life .
It would say you &apos;re wrong most of the time .
That was the computer we knew .
It &apos;s a room broken in two halves .
And the floppy disk drive person wears it .
Remember that excitement ?
You see this little pattern here ?
Well , content is the word up there : fear .
Like , we gotta go to Fear .
It &apos;s , like , amazing , right ?
It just changes the same content .
You feel for them .
Or you change the typeface to something like this .
I can never get in there .
Free bold feels like Mandela free .
It &apos;s like , yes , I can be free .
Design does that .
So -- yeah .
This was a square that responds to sound .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tap , Type , Write . &quot;
It has 10 variations .
There &apos;s a shift .
This is , like , a ring of letters .
It &apos;s peaceful , like that .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And why do we have this facility ?
And the shopkeeper would say , &quot; It &apos;s old . &quot;
&quot; Tell us more . &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s really old . &quot;
It &apos;s about something in between .
We aren &apos;t functioning so easily anymore .
We aren &apos;t a simple authoritarian regime anymore .
It was like , &quot; No swimming , no hiking , no anything . &quot;
And also &quot; no love . &quot;
So that is authoritarianism .
And what is that , structurally ?
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree .
Someone who &apos;s creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
And it felt kind of like being president , actually .
How many coffees do you have ?
How often are you calling them , emailing them ?
They &apos;re targeted social media systems around leaders .
Emiliano Salinas : A civil response to violence
I was born in 1976 .
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family .
Don &apos;t worry .
I think we have a problem in Mexico .
We have a big problem .
I think there &apos;s consensus on this .
Corruption ? Poverty ? Or is it something else ?
We are a country of victims .
Then we were victims of the French .
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio .
Then we were victims of the PRI .
Even of Salinas .
And of El Peje .
Hold on ! Wait a minute !
The problem is not the things we feel victims of .
The problem is that we play the role of victims .
The first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy .
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Mexico has cancer .
Many people in Mexico are afraid today .
We &apos;re very afraid .
And we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
Less safe !
We need to confront this fear .
For many people , acting involves courage .
We go from fear to courage .
They say , &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
Usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
Now we &apos;re experiencing one every week .
It means it &apos;s determined and effective , but not violent .
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico .
So what did they do ?
We &apos;ll be waiting for you right here . &quot;
They stayed there .
Of course , criminals can respond .
And in this case , they did .
But he keeps fighting .
He keeps organizing .
He keeps mobilizing .
And they &apos;re out there !
They just have to raise their hands .
That devotion we feel for the national football team .
A mother is the most sacred thing in life .
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history .
What are we going to do ?
Masiosare , the strange enemy , is here .
We need Ghandis .
We &apos;re facing a very powerful opponent .
But we are many more .
They can take a man &apos;s life .
Anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
The battle is won , but we still have to fight it .
Thank you .
Evelyn Glennie : How to truly listen
That &apos;s my only real aim in life .
So technically , I can actually read this .
I will do exactly as I &apos;m told .
There &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
I &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
And I &apos;m being told the dynamic .
And I &apos;m also being told that the drum is without snares .
Snares on , snares off .
Now my career may last a little longer !
Just the basic feeling .
However , that is simply not enough .
And I &apos;m doing far , far less .
Not just translate them , but interpret them .
And I said , &quot; Well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , I think I hear it through here . &quot;
that of a difference . Then gradually ... and gradually ...
They &apos;re all different .
Same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
And I just couldn &apos;t quite accept that .
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
I have the sound coming this way .
He would have the sound coming through the resonators .
Can you hear anything ?
Exactly . Because I &apos;m not even touching it .
Do you see what I mean ?
Whatever the eye sees , then there &apos;s always sound happening .
And this is quite interesting .
In another year &apos;s time , three extra steps .
I &apos;m assuming we &apos;ve all experienced thunder .
Audience : No .
Try again . Snow .
See , you &apos;re awake .
So we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
And that &apos;s exactly what he did .
We had to study from study books .
&quot; Why am I practicing paradiddles ?
They &apos;re experiencing that rawness there .
But thank you very much for having me !
Adam Sadowsky : How to engineer a viral music video
Hi there .
50-million-plus views on YouTube .
A fantastically viral and wonderful video .
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling .
They wanted us to make use of the space .
It included an exterior loading dock .
They wanted it messy , and we were happy to oblige .
The machine itself would start the music .
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout .
Okay .
They wanted it to end precisely on time .
Okay .
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions .
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times .
And we learned that small stuff stinks .
Life can be messy .
Thank you very much .
OK Go : An introduction . Hello TEDxUSC .
We are OK Go .
I mean , &quot; Curiosity &quot; -- excuse me .
Let me start again .
Tim &apos;s sundial hat .
Sorry , start again .
Dogs .
James Hansen : Why I must speak out about climate change
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere ?
Or was Venus extremely hot ?
The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century .
All of these impacts or are now well under way .
But there were consequences .
So the key quantity is Earth &apos;s energy imbalance .
If so , more warming is in the pipeline .
Yet , there was more energy coming in than going out .
Now consider Earth &apos;s climate history .
But that lag is exactly what is expected .
The physics does not change .
There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning .
What sea level rise can we look forward to ?
Where you are sitting now would be under water .
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .
There would be no stable shoreline .
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
Global warming is already affecting people .
Jake is a super-positive , enthusiastic boy .
Does not enlarge government .
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices .
Sounds like a conservative climate plan . &quot;
A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth .
That is the equivalent of what we face now .
But we aren &apos;t even starting .
Clearly , I haven &apos;t gotten this message across .
The science is clear .
We owe it to our children and grandchildren .
Thank you .
Laura Snyder : The Philosophical Breakfast Club
An elderly , white-haired man stands up .
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly .
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed .
The philosophical breakfast club changed that , working together .
The four men really helped each other in every way .
It had a separate memory and central processor .
And for the first time , they gave women a foot in the door of science .
That &apos;s the heroic part of their story .
There &apos;s a flip side as well .
and &quot; What proportion of the Earth is covered in water ? &quot;
Thank you .
Zach Kaplan : Keith and I lead a research team .
So , a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors .
For me , I really love this idea .
Do you have a need for speed ?
Aqua Rocket : coming this summer .
Now this is important for two reasons .
It &apos;s because of this that you need the magnetic braking system .
Now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
There &apos;re a few different versions of it .
Some of them automatically unroll like this one .
An olive server .
You sir , come on up .
Steve Jurvetson : Steve .
We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign .
Right there . That &apos;s great .
And hold onto this . Good luck to you .
No , not yet .
Little bit -- that &apos;s perfect , just perfect .
SJ : It &apos;s cold .
It &apos;s perfectly clear , it &apos;s odorless , it &apos;s colorless .
It &apos;s so safe you could drink this stuff .
All right , well thanks for coming up .
SJ : Excellent , thank you .
So what &apos;s the significance of this dry liquid ?
You can circulate it to draw the heat away .
We have a video to show you .
It &apos;s technically called , &quot; shape-retaining property . &quot;
As this paper is bending , the resistance of the ink changes .
Old Milk Carton : Oh yeah , it smells good .
Who are you ?
New Milk Carton : I &apos;m New Milk .
OMC : I used to smell like you .
Packaging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off .
Don &apos;t let milk spoil your morning .
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Rose George : Let &apos;s talk crap . Seriously .
Let &apos;s talk dirty .
That &apos;s the other WTO .
They don &apos;t have a bucket or a box .
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet .
Still not sure about the bikini .
And here &apos;s another image of diarrhea .
This is Marie Saylee , nine months old .
And that &apos;s her dad .
It &apos;s a very potent weapon of mass destruction .
But we know how to fix this .
Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history .
It &apos;s a wonderful waste disposal device .
We don &apos;t have a neutral word for it .
Poop &apos;s not particularly adequate .
No one &apos;s going to refuse clean water .
And I understand that . Who can blame them ?
Poop can cook your dinner .
It &apos;s got nutrients in it .
We don &apos;t keep them all .
So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare .
There is now a new career path called stool donor .
It &apos;s like the new sperm donor .
She &apos;s been suffering for years .
It &apos;s astonishing , but hardly anyone is still doing it .
Maybe it &apos;s the ick factor .
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion .
It &apos;s called &quot; No Loo , No I Do . &quot;
She &apos;d grown up with a latrine .
She was scared of snakes . She was scared of rape .
She left .
But not just that .
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera .
That &apos;s what really made them change their behavior .
But there are things to worry about .
It &apos;s the most off-track Millennium Development Goal .
It &apos;s about 50 or so years off track .
They &apos;ve made it conversational .
People go out and upgrade their toilet .
They talk about it . They &apos;ve sanitized it .
Our sewers are crumbling .
The solution to all of this is pretty easy .
Thank you .
Frank Gehry : My days as a young rebel
I &apos;m going to go right into the slides .
Let me go right into the slides .
Can you turn off the light ? Down .
I like to be in the dark .
This is in Venice .
And we continue to work with this client .
The building on the right at the top is now under construction .
They wanted a sense of place .
And the success of it threw me for a loop .
So , nobody would like this .
And after we failed , I just kept failing .
So , it was an accidental discovery .
I got into fish .
I did this building in Japan .
And the client said , &quot; Why no fish ? &quot;
It was pretty hard .
It was a dialog with the context again .
Couldn &apos;t find it .
So ...
This was built in six months .
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
So , I decided to cut off the head and the tail .
And , finally , Jay dragged me to my hometown , Toronto , Canada .
I played with it in the evening .
And the next night , we had gefilte fish .
It was a joke .
I play with funny people like &#91; Claes &#93; Oldenburg .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
And we &apos;ve started to work on things .
He was the Swiss Army knife .
P for Palladio .
The highlight of the performance was at the end .
I had nothing to do with it .
We made it into a sailing craft .
People hate it .
And I &apos;m always drawn to that .
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School .
And that chain link is really expensive .
It &apos;s in perspective and everything .
And you can see , we started making a building together .
Of course , the milk can is his .
And he pushed that .
And one day I had a -- oh , well , the other way .
It led to the building on the left .
I just tell the stories .
And it &apos;s just a complex of factory buildings .
It &apos;s copper and galvanize .
And they end up looking like stone .
This is the central area .
There &apos;s a ramp .
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job .
And so Stanley did the little dome thing .
And we did it over the phone and by fax .
He would send me a fax and show me something .
I told him , &quot; No , no , that &apos;s too ongepotchket .
I don &apos;t want the tower . &quot;
And so I decided to put him in a depression .
And I call it , &quot; David and Goliath . &quot;
And that &apos;s my cafeteria .
And the shape fit perfectly .
I just joined the points .
In the curved part there &apos;s all the mechanical equipment .
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it .
This is a small house somewhere .
It &apos;s in the West Valley .
These are the models .
The reality , with the lake -- the workmanship is pretty bad .
It &apos;s kind of like a whole built town .
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that .
The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it .
He was too busy .
He didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
Etc. etc .
You &apos;ve got the idea .
And so we finally ended up making it .
These people are art collectors .
I keep trying to make it work .
In Cleveland , there &apos;s Burnham Mall , on the left .
It &apos;s never been finished .
There &apos;s a railroad track .
This is the city hall over here somewhere , and the courthouse .
And the centerline of the mall goes out .
You drive down .
So it &apos;s about a 10-story C-clamp .
And this would be a hotel .
It &apos;s hard to do high-rise .
I feel much more comfortable down here .
This is a piece of property in Brentwood .
And that &apos;s it , built .
The dome was a request from the client .
She didn &apos;t care where .
And it &apos;s very private .
These aren &apos;t focused very well .
I don &apos;t know how to do it from here .
Focus the one on the right .
It &apos;s up there .
Left -- it &apos;s my right .
That &apos;s the living room .
Servants &apos; quarters .
And then you enter into the living room and then so on .
This is the bedroom .
The material is lead copper , like in the building in Boston .
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free .
This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney .
We &apos;re doing some work for him .
Kind of a fun thing to do .
And we struggled with the image .
This is in Paris , along the Seine .
Palais des Sports , the Gare de Lyon over here .
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here .
There &apos;s a new library across the river .
In a very tight , small -- this is the ground level .
They call it the plan coupe .
These are the models for it .
Apartments , etc .
And these are the kind of study models we did .
And the one on the left is pretty awful .
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc .
And it faces into a park .
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
And it &apos;s got a fish .
It &apos;s like a drug addict .
And then I do it .
There it is .
But it &apos;s the living room .
We &apos;ve had a lot of fun working together .
So far .
This is a shopping thing .
And another restaurant .
It &apos;s plaster and just zinc .
I know I &apos;m over time .
So it &apos;s pretty quiet inside .
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall .
It &apos;s a complicated project .
It has a chamber hall .
And the plan of this -- it &apos;s a concert hall .
This is the foyer , which is kind of a garden structure .
There &apos;s commercial at the ground floor .
But finally , there &apos;s a hotel there .
You have to then try and get that back in some way .
And we studied many models .
This was our original model .
Everybody liked the surround .
That &apos;s the idea .
And so it will be quite a different shape .
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi .
I just stuck it on there .
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs .
And we split these bridges .
Originally , this was all solid with a hole in it .
Time goes on .
And the food wasn &apos;t as good as the stuff , and so it failed .
It didn &apos;t work .
Thank you very much .
We have half a million laptops today in the hands of children .
So , in rough numbers , there are a million laptops .
In Colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
They &apos;ve leapfrogged .
Before , they were closed off .
Now what are some of the results ?
They own the laptops . They take them home .
Her mother had not gone to primary school .
This is an education project , not a laptop project .
Nate Silver : Does racism affect how you vote ?
I want to talk about the election .
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well .
He won 375 electoral votes .
One exception is in Massachusetts .
That was John Kerry &apos;s home state .
This kind of Arkansas , Tennessee , Oklahoma , West Virginia region .
There is a book written called , &quot; What &apos;s the Matter with Kansas ? &quot;
But yeah , what &apos;s the matter with Arkansas ?
They asked this question .
Here is the same data on a map .
So we have to ask why .
Is there something driving this ?
Or are there more systematic factors at work ?
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables .
So yes , racism is predictable .
There is a big difference .
I &apos;m a big fan of cities .
Denis Dutton : A Darwinian theory of beauty
It &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
Beethoven is adored in Japan .
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints .
How can we explain this universality ?
It did not evolve for natural survival .
In fact , it goes against natural survival .
It &apos;s quite a familiar story .
It &apos;s women who actually push history forward .
He actually used that word .
How about artistic beauty ?
Isn &apos;t that exhaustively cultural ?
No , I don &apos;t think it is .
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes .
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years .
What were these artifacts for ?
It &apos;s hard to grasp , but it &apos;s an incredible fact .
Yes , hairstyling -- I insist on that .
We find beauty in something done well .
No , it &apos;s deep in our minds .
Thank you .
Once upon a time , there was a place called Lesterland .
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States .
Now , Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power .
There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland .
One is called the general election .
The other is called the Lester election .
And here &apos;s the trick .
Okay . That &apos;s Lesterland .
Number one , the United States is Lesterland .
The United States is Lesterland .
You don &apos;t necessarily have to win . There is Jerry Brown .
But you must do extremely well .
Now you say , really ?
Really .05 percent ?
In this sense , the funders are our Lesters .
Now , what can we say about this democracy in USA-land ?
Okay , the United States is Lesterland , point number one .
Here &apos;s point number two .
It &apos;s at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland .
I don &apos;t mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption .
I don &apos;t mean any criminal act .
The corruption I &apos;m talking about is perfectly legal .
So here &apos;s the model of government .
This is a corruption .
So the right wants smaller government .
But here &apos;s the bad news .
Block reform .
It feeds on dysfunction .
This is the root .
Okay , now , every single one of you knows this .
We need a government that works .
There will never be a Christmas .
So it &apos;s not that mine is the most important issue . It &apos;s not .
Okay . So how do we do it ?
The analytics are easy here .
Now I get this skepticism .
I get this cynicism . I get this sense of impossibility .
But I don &apos;t buy it .
This is a solvable issue .
Irrelevant .
There &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
When she said that , I scrambled .
What is that sense of hopelessness ? &quot;
Nothing you can do . &quot;
I &apos;m going off to build Google Glass .
Do you have that love ?
A republic . A representative democracy .
A government dependent upon the people alone .
We have lost that republic .
All of us have to act to get it back .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
It &apos;s about a tenth of a millimeter .
That &apos;s how small that is .
This is a ring of cobalt atoms .
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
You have things like coral .
So here &apos;s , for example , a picture of sand from Maui .
There &apos;s some sand that &apos;s really much more colorful .
They &apos;re like a snapshot in time .
And you can see those in micrometeorites .
So sort of left-eye view , right-eye view .
This is a very small grain of sand , this whole thing .
And that &apos;s called a ring agglutinate .
Thank you .
Edith Widder : The weird , wonderful world of bioluminescence
But mostly I &apos;m entranced by it .
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .
Oops . Sorry .
Okay .
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light ?
The flash is like a scream for help .
It &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
It &apos;s got a chin barbel .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
The light organs under the eyes are flashing .
That chin barbel is flashing .
It &apos;s got light organs on its belly that are flashing , fin lights .
It &apos;s a scream for help ; it &apos;s meant to attract attention .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
This blinds or distracts the predator .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
They &apos;re things like this .
This is a golden coral , a bush .
It grows very slowly .
And you see things like this .
And these are flytrap anemones .
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
There are starfish that can make light .
But we have no idea why it does that .
It &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
It &apos;s a green saber of light .
We call it the electronic jellyfish .
So the camera &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high-resolution .
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
There &apos;s something small there that responds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
And this was very consistent .
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish .
And this is a burglar alarm .
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon .
But we did see a bunch of responses like this .
This guy is a little more contemplative .
&quot; Hey , wait a minute .
There &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s persistent .
He keeps coming back .
Nope .
But I warn you , it &apos;s addictive .
Thank you .
Vusi Mahlasela : &quot; Thula Mama &quot;
This is your place , you stay here . &quot;
And they left .
Gary Lauder &apos;s new traffic sign : Take Turns
I &apos;ve had some time to think it over .
Roundabouts are much better .
But that &apos;s just safety .
What about time and gas ?
Small roundabouts are starting to appear .
But they are not applicable in all situations .
So , take , for example , the three-way intersection .
But the other two are somewhat questionable .
Cars rarely appear on that third road .
And so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
What &apos;s that time worth ?
And you &apos;d still come out ahead .
Can that be accomplished with existing signs ?
So , why not use a yield sign ?
That would not work .
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
So , now that you are all &quot; Road Scholars &quot; ...
Maira Kalman : The illustrated woman
And we started a studio .
So , I get to put in all of the things that I love .
I never -- I don &apos;t like plots .
I don &apos;t know what a plot means .
The letter C had other things in it .
They &apos;re not . &quot;
I said , people should know about this book .
&quot; Well , Susan , this is a fine mess you are in . &quot;
Do you mind my asking a question ? &quot;
&quot; Would , could , should , or would , should , could . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes , but how much space do I have ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; It &apos;s unlimited , it &apos;s unlimited . &quot;
I happen to know it for a fact .
You don &apos;t even know .
So , &quot; My beautiful mother &apos;s family fled Russia as well .
Too many pogroms .
Facts were actually banished from our home .
So , it &apos;s a miracle that I &apos;m here today .
Well , not so awful .
There &apos;s consoling .
And he says , &quot; It is impossible not to lie .
It is February and not lying is impossible . &quot;
What is it that we &apos;re actually -- what story are we actually telling ?
How do we know when we are ourselves ?
I &apos;m going to quickly go through this .
A complicated question .
Oh my God , you know what ?
Could we have -- no , we don &apos;t have time .
Do you have that ?
Gershwin died at the age of 38 .
He &apos;s buried in the same cemetery as my husband .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that now .
And I would like to run it for them .
And a woman who lives on our street , Lolita .
And then I go and have some tea .
That &apos;s actually Hy .
I happen to be alive , end of discussion . Thank you .
This is a vending machine in Los Angeles .
It &apos;s in a shopping mall , and it sells fish eggs .
It &apos;s a caviar vending machine .
Because strawberry DNA is really fascinating , because it &apos;s so beautiful .
These are people who don &apos;t necessarily regularly engage with science whatsoever .
And so I started doing this regularly .
This is what that looked like .
And it started to make me think about a couple of things .
And I hadn &apos;t even thought about that .
Here it is .
And how much will these samples be worth ?
And what will you be able to do with that sample ?
Thank you .
Dan Dennett : The illusion of consciousness
They &apos;re just strongly held opinions .
No , you &apos;ve got it all wrong . &quot;
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
Now , this nice picture shows a thought-balloon , a thought-bubble .
I think everybody understands what that means .
That &apos;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re made of .
It speaks so eloquently to the problem .
Don &apos;t take the thrill of it away . I &apos;d rather be mystified .
Don &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot;
I &apos;m going to do what philosophers do .
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick ?
And the same is true of consciousness .
Watch it carefully .
We &apos;re looking for a backer .
It &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
Every one . I &apos;ll just show you by running it again .
That &apos;s the detail part .
It doesn &apos;t seem that way , does it ?
It &apos;s in the museum in North Carolina .
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto &apos;s .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
I don &apos;t think so . Not a chance . But then , how on Earth is it done ?
It &apos;s the same thing .
It &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
Let &apos;s just do this experiment very quickly .
Yes .
How many of you rotated the one on the right ? OK .
Yes , it &apos;s possible to do that .
Can you see it ?
Well , you know , in effect , the boundary &apos;s really there , in a certain sense .
It &apos;s a Necker cube .
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube ? OK .
Because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth , always true .
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .
This is change-blindness .
So now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
We &apos;re going to start easy . Some examples .
No trouble there .
Can everybody see ? All right .
Can you see that one ?
2.9 seconds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
It &apos;s easy .
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking .
This one because it &apos;s so large and yet it &apos;s pretty hard to see .
Can you see it ?
Audience : Yes .
How many still don &apos;t see it ? How many still don &apos;t see it ?
Right in the middle of the picture !
Thanks very much for your attention .
And we &apos;re really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind .
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
Thank you very much .
Actually , it &apos;s deceptively large .
Obviously a very small community .
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then .
I knew them both .
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case .
It was incredibly successful .
I &apos;ll come back to that later .
And so , there are many of those things that start to happen .
That will not succeed .
Nobody has claimed credit for that .
There was basically a factory of industrial machines .
Everything started breaking .
But so what we need is a plan B.
There is no plan B right now .
It &apos;s basically a matter of deciding to do it .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
Thank you very much .
Stefan Larsson : What doctors can learn from each other
There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
We call this value-based healthcare .
The differences were dramatic .
And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
So going the hospital is a lottery .
Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
And they finally agreed .
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
Since then , they publish every year .
Now I found this principle really exciting .
Continuous improvement .
Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physicians have another characteristic .
They actually thrive from peer recognition .
They will share the information on how to improve .
This is happening in reality .
Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
Can we measure it better than we do ?
There was an enormous energy in the room .
There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
Thank you .
Brian Cox : Why we need the explorers
This is the U.K. government spend .
That funds everything in the U.K.
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
So it isn &apos;t in the series .
It &apos;s of the moon Enceladus .
It &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
So , tiny moon .
What &apos;s fascinating and beautiful ...
It &apos;s a beautiful graphic .
That &apos;s one more picture of Enceladus .
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus .
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think .
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .
Well , there is .
Earthrise from Apollo 8 .
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics .
So exploration can pay for itself .
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
And they saw strange pictures like this .
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun .
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum .
And that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
It &apos;s called &quot; helios &quot; -- helios from the Sun .
That &apos;s a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
That &apos;s quite an incredible prediction .
Well , this is a picture of it .
That &apos;s a Type Ia supernova explosion .
Now that &apos;s an incredible phenomena , because it &apos;s a star that sits there .
It &apos;s called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
It sits there about , say , 1.3 times the mass of the Sun .
In fact , that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet .
It looks like Saturn because , of course , it is .
It was taken by the Cassini space probe .
That &apos;s our planet from 750 million miles away .
The Voyager is a tiny machine .
And it took this picture of Earth .
That &apos;s Earth from four billion miles away .
He said , &quot; Consider again that dot .
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
Surely , we know enough .
He was clearly under assault all the time .
&quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19th century .
Just exploit it ; just build things . &quot;
Thank you .
Janna Levin : The sound the universe makes
The Sun burns our peripheral vision .
We see light reflected off the Moon .
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
We can &apos;t see them directly .
They destroy stars around them .
They churn up debris in their surroundings .
It was Einstein &apos;s great general theory of relativity .
These are the natural curves in space .
And even light could not escape this current .
He did not believe they existed in nature .
It &apos;s actually not massive enough .
But basically that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
It cannot hide behind the black hole .
They can see you .
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second .
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light .
This was one of the groups .
You would literally hear the sound .
And we can predict what the sound will be .
Then it &apos;s gone .
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
It &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
This is another sound from my group .
Want to get away from the sound .
Both black holes are moving .
Both black holes are getting closer together .
In this case , they &apos;re both wobbling quite a lot .
And then they &apos;re going to merge .
Now it &apos;s gone .
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
They look like they &apos;re frozen in some embrace .
It might make a sound .
So imagine you &apos;re inside the Big Bang .
It &apos;s everywhere , it &apos;s all around you , and the space is wobbling chaotically .
We weren &apos;t even here .
It &apos;s like hurry , build your instruments .
It &apos;s getting closer and closer , and in 20 ...
It &apos;s a terrible sound .
It &apos;s literally the definition of noise .
It &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
Will it happen again ?
Here &apos;s my multiverse creatures .
Thank you . Thank you .
Joe Kowan : I have stage fright .
I had this irrational fear .
Well , when I got there , it was packed .
There were like 20 people there .
And they all looked angry .
Now , when you experience fear , your sympathetic nervous system kicks in .
I mean , your nervous system is an idiot .
I mean , it &apos;s a nightmare .
It was so bad .
I couldn &apos;t shake it .
And that &apos;s when I had an epiphany .
Except for when I was really nervous , like now .
Can I have a sip of water ?
Thank you .
Alan Kay : A powerful idea about ideas
He would have a great time .
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled .
So what do artists do ? Well , what artists do is to measure .
They measure very , very carefully .
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel .
I &apos;ll talk about that a little bit .
But how simple ?
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
and bingo . That is all you have to do .
Now let &apos;s go to young children .
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there .
So they had created these artifacts .
&quot; What have you noticed about what you did ? &quot;
So that &apos;s what Lauren did .
Well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
Each time I click it , car turn .
And I can try steering the car here by ...
So what if I click this down to zero ?
Make it go in the other direction .
And we &apos;ll call this a wheel .
See this wheel &apos;s heading here ?
And it &apos;s interesting .
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did .
We &apos;re going to move the car according to that over and over again .
What do I get there ? &quot;
So how do the children do science ?
Student 1 : Ooh , this is nice .
Who &apos;s got the apple ?
Alan Kay : They &apos;ve got little stopwatches .
AK : Stopwatches aren &apos;t accurate enough .
Student 3 : 0.99 seconds .
Teacher : So put &quot; sponge ball &quot; ...
Teacher : Drop . Class : Whoa !
Now , what if we want to look at this more closely ?
And they say , &quot; Oh , yeah . Constant acceleration .
We &apos;ve done that already . &quot;
But if I oppose gravity , here we go ... Oops !
One more .
Thank you .
Rives : If I controlled the Internet
So ...
Now follow me , OK ?
One , two , three .
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather .
I wouldn &apos;t need it .
Huh ? Maybe Google would hire this .
I guess it &apos;s just like life .
We can interfere with the interface .
You don &apos;t say a prayer .
You don &apos;t write a psalm .
You don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
Thank you , TED .
Bill Davenhall : Your health depends on where you live
Can geographic information make you healthy ?
In 2001 I got hit by a train .
My train was a heart attack .
I started asking my questions , &quot; Well , why me ? &quot;
&quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
&quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
And you know why I understand that ?
What does that mean , my environment ?
Well , it can mean a lot of things .
We all have these .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown .
It was insidious and it was really happening .
And I moved to Redlands California .
Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
So , how many people are in the white ?
Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
Oh , not so lucky .
And it &apos;s not in yours either .
So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
Did you know that data existed ?
This might be what we end up with .
This could be my little assessment .
What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
But it will also be useful for us .
Just look at that for a minute .
Gary Wolf : The quantified self
I got up this morning at 6 : 10 a.m.
after going to sleep at 12 : 45 a.m.
I was awakened once during the night .
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer .
It tracks your movement through space .
This tracks your activity and also your sleep .
It has just that sensor in it .
You &apos;re probably familiar with the Nike + system .
And this is the sleep tracking system of today .
What is this for ?
What should it be for ?
Some people will say it &apos;s for biometric security .
Some people will say it &apos;s for public health research .
Some people will say it &apos;s for avant-garde marketing research .
Thank you .
JR : My wish : Use art to turn the world inside out
You have to make a wish to save the world . &quot;
I was lost .
The world is fucked up .
Except maybe French people .
Whatever .
I can &apos;t do anything to save the world . &quot;
&quot; Oh , all right . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s cool . &quot;
What about art ?
Could art change the world ?
I started when I was 15 years old .
That &apos;s how , at 17 years old , I started pasting them .
So that &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s on the Champs-Elysees .
I was quite proud of that one .
November 2005 : the streets are burning .
A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris .
I know those guys .
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens .
It was the only one I had at that time .
So could art change the world ?
Are they so different ?
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
We called the project Face 2 Face .
The experts said , &quot; No way .
The people will not accept .
&quot; It will be as big as your house . &quot;
Okay , for example , that &apos;s Palestine .
We &apos;re in Ramallah right now .
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . &quot;
And then there was always a silence .
&quot; Well , yeah , yeah , that &apos;s part of the project . &quot;
And most of them couldn &apos;t say .
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
They are not meant to stay .
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting .
I called that project Women Are Heroes .
I just observed .
I just took their pictures and pasted them .
I was shocked .
All Brazil was shocked .
So I decided to go there .
And she said , &quot; You know what ?
We &apos;re hungry for culture .
We need culture out there . &quot;
So I went out and I started with the kids .
But that &apos;s okay .
I took more photos , and we started the project .
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy .
Everyone there understood the project .
What was interesting is that the media couldn &apos;t get in .
I mean , you should see that .
So how can we know about the project ?
We kept traveling .
I mean , they want to know what you &apos;re up to .
They kept asking me , &quot; What is the purpose of your project ?
Art . Just doing art .
Some people question , &quot; Why is it in black and white ?
Don &apos;t you have color in France ? &quot;
This is art . &quot;
Then art becomes useful .
So the people kept it .
&quot; Oh , that guy just moved . &quot;
When you look at Kibera now , they look back .
Okay , India .
In India it was just impossible to paste .
So we decided to paste white , white on the walls .
So imagine white guys pasting white papers .
Of course , they were confused .
Thank you .
So we didn &apos;t get caught this time .
Okay .
For each project we do a film .
Behind each image is a story .
We did that in most of the places .
We go back regularly .
And that has always been a central part of the work .
But tell me , advertising for what ?
But they asked me for a promise basically .
So I did . That &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s Rio .
You understand the full scope of the project .
That &apos;s London .
New York .
And today , they are with you in Long Beach .
In some ways , art can change the world .
Art can change the way we see the world .
Art can create an analogy .
They would be really useful . &quot;
Or , &quot; How can we help ? &quot;
And this starts right now .
Yes , everyone in the room .
Everyone watching .
I wanted that wish to actually start now .
What we see changes who we are .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Suzanne Lee : Grow your own clothes
So we start by brewing the tea .
And then we &apos;re ready to add the living organism .
And along with that , some acetic acid .
So this is my mini fabric farm .
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing .
And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid .
And this is a static culture .
It doesn &apos;t need light .
At this point , it &apos;s really heavy .
And using indigo , make it anti-microbial .
Align it in this direction .
Make it hydrophobic .
So we only grow what we need .
There &apos;s no waste .
Thank you very much .
SL : Yes , it is .
Suzanne Lee .
Jon Nguyen : Tour the solar system from home
I would watch Nova on PBS .
All right , so what about the rest of it ?
It &apos;s actually pretty busy .
So now we &apos;ve gone back in time .
We &apos;re now riding along with Voyager 1 .
The date here is November 11 , 1980 .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything &apos;s going on .
It looks like I &apos;ve paused the program .
It actually has a very thick atmosphere .
And I &apos;m going to recenter the camera on Saturn , here .
There &apos;s a point to be made here .
There &apos;s a whole story to tell here .
It actually flies underneath Saturn .
And , in fact , I &apos;m going to go back to the solar system .
You can manipulate it yourself .
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself .
Thank you .
Quixotic Fusion : Dancing with light
One billion people .
Imagine this scenario .
That &apos;s the part that works .
That &apos;s the part that &apos;s broken .
We call it Matternet .
We use three key technologies .
And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network .
These fly autonomously .
This is the key to the technology .
People there love this .
So this is a $ 3,000 vehicle .
Costs are coming down very rapidly .
That &apos;s roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan .
Compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
Half of the Earth &apos;s population lives in cities today .
Half a billion of us live in megacities .
Congestion is a huge problem .
So why are we doing this ?
Thank you .
Rives : Reinventing the encyclopedia game
So I tried .
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple .
And it is really fun to say .
You can use it at TED .
Chimborazo , right ?
I didn &apos;t know that ; that &apos;s pretty cool .
Chimborazo !
You just have to find another term and look that up .
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from .
They move ; they go up , they go down .
I didn &apos;t know it .
Chimborazo !
Famous for its diversity , human diversity .
This is the most successful order on the planet by far .
Fireflies are not flies , fireflies are beetles .
Yeah .
And the link to aphrodisiac .
I do like sympathy . I do like magic .
Sympathetic magic is imitation .
We &apos;ve got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork .
He doesn &apos;t .
He lives in rainforests and savannas .
Germans occupied Russia .
You can come back to Earth .
You return to where you started .
You can finish your game .
I found it myself .
It &apos;s got some math that I can do .
I &apos;m pretty sure my dad doesn &apos;t know it .
That &apos;s pretty cool .
I didn &apos;t know that .
Chimborazo !
Thank you .
Fiorenzo Omenetto : Silk , the ancient material of the future
Thank you .
I &apos;m thrilled to be here .
So that &apos;s kind of a bold statement .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
It actually gets reintegrated in the body .
And the material looks something like this .
In fact , this material you see is clear and transparent .
So this material is silk .
The process of discovery , generally , is inspired by nature .
And so we get this starting material .
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block .
And we take advantage of something that is very simple .
They find their way to self-assemble .
And so what does that mean ?
And we can store information that &apos;s film with water and protein .
So let me see .
It &apos;s actually not limited to films .
And so the material can assume a lot of formats .
You can add a third dimensionality to the film .
But you can do other things .
And you can think of different formats .
You can do bigger things .
And the gears work in water as well .
But there are still some unique traits .
And so what you see there is the difference .
So it allows for the recovery of what we &apos;ve stored before .
Thank you .
Sandra Aamodt : Why dieting doesn &apos;t usually work
That &apos;s a lot of food .
Successful dieting doesn &apos;t lower your set point .
So don &apos;t do that .
Diets don &apos;t have very much reliability .
Forty percent of them have gained even more .
How do you do it ?
Sit down to regular meals without distractions .
I often don &apos;t think about it .
I forget we have chocolate in the house .
It &apos;s like aliens have taken over my brain .
It &apos;s just completely different .
Let me leave you with one last thought .
Thanks .
Lee Cronin : Print your own medicine
Now what could this mean ?
So what could this mean ?
And this is what we &apos;re doing in the lab at the moment .
You don &apos;t need to go to the chemist anymore .
We can print drugs at point of need .
We can download new diagnostics .
Say a new super bug has emerged .
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly .
Beam me up , Scotty .
Eli Pariser : Beware online &quot; filter bubbles &quot;
It meant a connection to the world .
They disappeared .
Google &apos;s doing it too .
And here &apos;s my friend Daniel &apos;s screen shot .
Scott &apos;s results were full of them .
So it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook either .
This is something that &apos;s sweeping the Web .
So I do think this is a problem .
We need it to connect us all together .
Thank you .
Alan Russell : The potential of regenerative medicine
There are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
This is not regenerative medicine .
And this is just the same .
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here .
This is from &quot; The Untied States of America . &quot;
This is age versus cost of health care .
All those things do is change who pays .
They don &apos;t actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is .
You can prevent .
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance .
Today , with diabetes , what do we do ?
This is a newt re-growing its limb .
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs .
It &apos;s a wild concept .
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
The first is cellular therapies .
Secondly , we can use materials .
And he asked a very important question .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a compelling picture .
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .
This is the reality of diabetes .
This is a diabetic ulcer . It &apos;s tragic .
The treatment for this is amputation .
That &apos;s what the wound looked like 11 weeks later .
That material contained only natural signals .
This is a horse . The horse is not in pain .
Could you regenerate a limb ?
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
After treatment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is clinically relevant today .
But could you go a little further ?
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women &apos;s Hospital .
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
You see the cells coming back out .
Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data .
This was a randomized trial .
These are now two years out .
There go the cells .
It &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid .
All done in the lab .
Here &apos;s just one example before I close up .
This is equally tragic .
Many of those patients are very severely burned .
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed .
That &apos;s going to spray cells over that area .
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very powerful work .
Clearly the images kind of get that across .
It &apos;s no coincidence .
The European Union , same thing .
China , the same thing .
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center .
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars .
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along .
Thank you .
Terry Moore : Why is &apos; x &apos; the unknown ?
Where &apos;d that come from ?
One example among many .
But there were problems .
Trust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ?
And I thought that was worth sharing .
Mike Biddle : We can recycle plastic
I &apos;m a garbage man .
And I &apos;d like to start at the very beginning .
The more stuff that &apos;s mine , the better .
We see above-ground mines .
In fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
They have very different densities .
They have different electrical and magnetic properties .
And they even have different colors .
And they extract the metals by hand .
I call this environmental arbitrage .
This is just one example .
They store the plastics on the roofs .
And by the way , please don &apos;t try this technique at home .
Because after all , we &apos;re doing above-ground mining .
And we eventually broke the code .
This is the last frontier of recycling .
Well a good place to start is with waste .
We have enormous energy savings .
And they get to make more sustainable products .
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail .
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos .
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets .
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .
We took our clues from mother nature .
Thank you for your time .
Lalitesh Katragadda : Making maps to fight disaster , build economies
In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar .
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
But help was coming .
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker .
Maps matter .
And , closer to home , Chalua , an N.G. road in Bangalore .
Welcome to the new world .
Nathan Myhrvold : Cooking as never seen before
I went to chef school in France .
And it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
He &apos;s developed a very avant-garde cuisine .
None of them are taught in cooking schools .
This is a picture called a cutaway .
And the hope was two-fold .
Steaming ought to be faster .
So here &apos;s another one .
And one of our canning cutaways .
Here &apos;s our hamburger cutaway .
Of course , you &apos;re not actually working the whole time .
Most of the time is kind of sitting there .
Most people assume we use Photoshop .
I said , &quot; It would have to show up free . &quot;
In most cases , though , there was no glass .
The wok shot caught fire three times .
But hey , they grow back .
This is Fourier &apos;s law of heat conduction .
It &apos;s a partial differential equation .
We &apos;ve got lots of little tidbits in the book .
But you probably don &apos;t know that much about James Watt .
We also did a lot of calculation .
As you move side to side , it moves off .
Here &apos;s a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger .
And it &apos;s really simple , as you can see here .
Here &apos;s the final hamburger .
This is the 30-hour hamburger .
We make every aspect of this burger .
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it .
There &apos;s a mushroom , ketchup -- it goes on and on .
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .
Isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
So it &apos;s a great illustration of that .
We have a chapter on gels .
Anyway , here &apos;s the book .
Here it is .
2,438 pages .
And they &apos;re nice big pages too .
Brian Greene : Is our universe the only universe ?
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts .
Now this was revolutionary .
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static .
What &apos;s pushing on it ?
Here it is .
This number is small .
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
Now you might wonder , should you care ?
First off , what is it ?
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward .
That is , we all know about the usual three dimensions of space .
And in string theory , vibration determines everything .
So , what to do ?
Here &apos;s the idea .
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other .
Which means we have been asking the wrong question .
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make headway .
And that would be that .
Mystery solved , multiverse found .
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying .
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer .
But there &apos;s a little secret .
Each of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
I suspect the latter .
It appears that it may not always be that way .
and the message echoing across the ages is clear .
Thank you very much .
Brian , thank you .
Well it &apos;s hard to say .
Holy cow ! That &apos;s just amazing .
You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
Maybe some of these conversations can continue .
Thank you . Thank you , Brian .
Michael Tilson Thomas : Music and emotion through time
But he was tough when it came to music .
That was his passion for the music .
Both my parents really loved it .
Brah dada dadadadah . &quot;
And he ran around the bases .
And I thought , go figure .
It &apos;s a language that &apos;s still evolving .
It &apos;s so simple , so evocative .
So many emotions seem to be inside of it .
They &apos;re locations in the spectrum of sound .
And in the 17th century , it was more like this .
And in the 21st century ...
Mozart was the same way .
This was truly the music of the spheres .
Singer : Ah , bitter blow !
Ah , wicked , cruel fate !
Ah , baleful stars !
Ah , avaricious heaven !
It &apos;s just these two notes in the middle .
37 freakin &apos; vibrations .
Now this moment so fascinates me .
I find it such a profound one .
What happens when the music stops ?
Where does it go ? What &apos;s left ?
It &apos;s the passing on part . It &apos;s the &apos; why &apos; part of it .
Nobody knows .
What sticks with people ?
You can start anywhere . Ramble a bit .
Follow traces . Get lost . Be surprised , amused inspired .
Thank you .
Boghuma Kabisen Titanji : Ethical riddles in HIV research
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results .
The first of these is informed consent .
Now , this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy .
Thank you .
Jared Diamond : How societies can grow old better
It happens mainly under two conditions .
They face a cruel situation of no choice .
In those societies , older people are cared for .
They are fed . They remain valuable .
They &apos;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals .
We Americans move on the average every five years .
That &apos;s a huge problem .
Older people have that experience .
Younger people don &apos;t .
Some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
Thank you .
Jae Rhim Lee : My mushroom burial suit
And it &apos;s everywhere .
But it &apos;s just one chemical .
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
To me , this says three things .
First , don &apos;t become a cannibal .
I think there &apos;s a better solution .
Just a little .
And now about these ninja pajamas .
Thank you .
Jonathan Klein : Photos that changed the world
Okay , we &apos;re naive , we &apos;re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .
So let &apos;s begin with a group of images .
But I think we &apos;re looking for something more .
We &apos;re looking for something more .
Well , this image you &apos;ve all seen .
It changed our view of the physical world .
And at last , we appear to be doing something about it .
This destructive power takes many different forms .
There &apos;s another kind of crucifixion .
Let &apos;s go back a little .
Did the images change the world ?
No , but they had a major impact .
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery .
My company has 70 million images .
I have one image in my office .
Here it is .
And thank you to all the photographers .
John Hunter : Teaching with the World Peace Game
I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
I feel so fortunate .
It &apos;s a true feeling .
And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
It all started back in 1977 .
He said , &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot;
It was an experimental education program .
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; What do I do ? &quot;
She said , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And that question cleared the space .
His name is Chris Farina .
But the film has really gone places .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
You know the one .
You know that teacher ?
My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
So I thought , well they like to play games .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There are four countries around the board .
They have different assets , commercial and military .
And each country has a cabinet .
There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
That &apos;s not all .
And they &apos;ve done it several times too .
I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
The students run the game .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
And so I apologize to them as well .
Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot;
That &apos;s a breach there .
They are the toughest opponents .
And we were very upset .
That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
We have a letter in the game .
So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
&quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot;
She read two sentences .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
I was in tears .
We all lose .
He &apos;s been in many battles .
David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
JH : I get chills every time I see that .
But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend Brennan .
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
There was no way they could win .
They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
I &apos;ve failed them .
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
The parents were looking in the window .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
Will you accept it ? &quot;
And there are three seconds left on the clock .
And the game is won .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about warfare .
But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
If only .
Nic Marks : The Happy Planet Index
He said , &quot; I have a dream . &quot;
And I have a dream .
We have focused on the worst-case scenario .
We have focused on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solutions .
A deer freezes very , very still , poised to run away .
What would it be like to be improving the human lot ?
Come on . In the Western world , we have enough .
This is from a global survey .
It &apos;s asking people , what do they want .
Okay , they think money is slightly important .
It &apos;s not nearly as important as health .
We want to be healthy and live a full life .
These seem to be natural human aspirations .
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet .
And economics is very interested in scarcity .
It is an efficiency measure .
More is bad .
It &apos;s about the well-being of nations .
It &apos;s like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
But now for the good news !
This is an aspirational graph .
They &apos;re Latin American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven &apos;t been to .
Maybe some of you have .
Costa Rica .
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years .
That is longer than in the USA .
They are the happiest place .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in Costa Rica ?
We can look at some of the data .
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949 .
They have the social connectedness .
It might be Latin American .
That &apos;s what we need to do .
And then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human lifetime away .
This is not the very distant future .
That is changing our business .
And the point is , we need to carry on increasing well-being .
I think we want it to carry on .
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
Human beings are very motivated by the &quot; now . &quot;
What would that look like for society ?
And why do I hear that ?
That &apos;s how you create a collective goal .
At a personal level , we need these nudges too .
What are these for happiness ?
Keep building them .
The second one is be active .
Being active is great for our positive mood .
The third one is take notice .
It &apos;s more curiosity .
Keep learning .
We feel good if we give .
They don &apos;t have any carbon content .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .
Human beings want to be happy .
Pave them with the five ways .
Shirin Neshat : Art in exile
Well , it has its pluses and minuses .
Politics have defined our lives .
We are there to take pride and insist on respect .
And at the same time , we &apos;re fighting another battle .
Our artists are at risk .
We are in a position of danger .
We pose a threat to the order of the government .
Art is our weapon .
Culture is a form of resistance .
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 .
For me , this became incredibly important .
So my art became slightly more critical .
My knife became a little sharper .
And I fell into a life in exile .
I am a nomadic artist .
Now I am making films .
It &apos;s a magical realist novel .
And most of all , in the way that we fought for democracy .
These are some of the images of the coup .
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story .
These are some of the images and the characters of the film .
The green movement significantly inspired the world .
They &apos;re absolutely inspirational for me .
That , under all circumstances , they have pushed the boundary .
They have confronted the authority .
And once again , they proved themselves .
Thank you so much .
Beau Lotto : Optical illusions show how we see
I want to start with a game .
And you have to tell me which one .
Really ? Okay .
How many people think it &apos;s the green one ?
And how many people think it &apos;s the orange one ?
Pretty even split .
Let &apos;s find out what the reality is .
Here is the orange one .
Here is the green one .
And here is the gray one .
So , this is pretty amazing , actually , isn &apos;t it ?
And yet , even at this most fundamental level , context is everything .
And instead of telling you , I &apos;ll just show you .
Can anyone see it ? Anyone ? No ?
And now you see it .
And these are two projections from the world .
They are identical in every single way .
Identical in shape , size , spectral content .
They are the same , as far as your eye is concerned .
And yet they come from completely different sources .
And yet it &apos;s only the retinal information that we get .
So how on Earth do we even see ?
There is no inherent meaning in information .
It &apos;s what we do with that information that matters .
Audience : &quot; Can you read this ? &quot;
&quot; You are not reading this . &quot;
&quot; What are you reading ? &quot;
But you put one there . Why ?
Why ? Because it wouldn &apos;t have been useful in the past .
So you don &apos;t do it again .
So , if I could have the lights down up here .
One is simply the flipping of the other . Okay ?
And I want you to stare at that dot . Don &apos;t look anywhere else .
But I really want you to learn .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s learning . Okay ?
So why don &apos;t you do that now ?
Can I have the lights up again ?
That &apos;s your new normal .
So , what does this mean for context ?
What &apos;s significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter .
So I &apos;ll show you what I mean . Here we have that exact same illusion .
And the same thing over on the right .
So you see it that way .
So you see it that way .
This is one I made a few years ago .
The four blue tiles on the left are gray .
The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray .
They are the same . Okay ?
Don &apos;t believe me ? Let &apos;s watch it again .
Now I want you to keep looking at it .
Move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye .
Yes ? Raise your hand if you got that . Yes ?
So I can ask you , which direction is it rotating ?
How do you know ?
Are we the only ones that see illusions ?
The answer to this question is no .
And we do this in what we call the Bee Matrix .
And you &apos;ll see one of the bees come out here .
You see how she has a little number on her ?
Now , they are not born that way . Right ?
We pull them out , put them in the fridge , and they fall asleep .
And here she comes down the ladder .
It looks like they &apos;re going to green flowers .
Now , are they getting it wrong ?
And the answer to the question is no . Those are actually blue flowers .
But those are blue flowers under green light .
Okay , this is complete rubbish .
And how we see is by continually redefining normality .
And they can navigate the world using their ears .
On the left is what his camera sees .
That line is broken up into 32 squares .
In each square we calculate the average color .
And then we just simply translate that into sound .
He finds it . Amazing . Right ?
And then we translated these images .
And this is one of those images .
And this is what it sounds like .
So , a six-year-old child . Okay ?
Now , what does all this mean ?
And that ecology is necessarily relative , historical and empirical .
So what I &apos;d like to finish with is this over here .
So , if we have the lights down .
I &apos;m going to do this opposite on the left here .
Agreed ? Yes ?
Okay . So they are physically the same .
Let &apos;s pull the covers off .
Do they look the same ? No .
The question is , &quot; Is that an illusion ? &quot;
And I &apos;ll leave you with that .
So , thank you very much .
David Pogue : The music wars
A TED medley -- a TEDley .
Martin Seligman : The new era of positive psychology
So I said , &quot; Well , how many words do I get ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Well , one . &quot;
&quot; Good . &quot;
&quot; Cut . Cut . That won &apos;t do .
We &apos;d really better give you a longer sound bite . &quot;
Doctor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
&quot; Not good . &quot;
We &apos;d better give you a real sound bite .
This time you can have three words .
Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
So , why was psychology good ?
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses .
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses .
The second cost was that we forgot about you people .
No one works on that .
So that was not good .
And how do they differ from the rest of us ?
And it turns out there &apos;s one way .
They don &apos;t sit in seminars on Saturday morning .
They don &apos;t spend time alone .
The first happy life is the pleasant life .
That &apos;s what Aristotle was talking about .
And third , the meaningful life .
And , as I said , it &apos;s not particularly malleable .
And this leads to the second life .
And the reason he was , was that Len is a cold fish .
Len is an introvert .
But it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
You &apos;re one with the music . Time stops .
You have intense concentration .
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life .
Hated the job .
She &apos;s working her way through college .
Now obviously she failed .
You don &apos;t look like Debbie Reynolds .
The second path is eudaimonian flow .
And the third path is meaning .
It &apos;s being done in a rigorous manner .
Close your eyes .
The person has to be alive . OK .
Now , OK , you can open your eyes .
I hope all of you have such a person .
And fun versus philanthropy .
So those are examples of positive interventions .
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest .
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong .
But they were empty .
AnnMarie Thomas : Hands-on science with squishy circuits
I &apos;m a huge believer in hands-on education .
But you have to have the right tools .
You see that really salty Play-Doh ?
Well , it conducts electricity .
And this is nothing new .
And that sugar dough ?
So what does that mean ?
If I push these together , the light turns off .
It &apos;s like a wall to the electricity .
I plug in again the power to it .
I can start plugging in lots of lights .
And we can start talking about things like electrical load .
It &apos;ll dim .
So this is all in your home kitchen .
Have fun . Thank you .
Billy Graham : On technology and faith
And I was so stimulated .
I was to address a conference at a hotel .
And the man said , &quot; No , who ? &quot;
He said , &quot; You don &apos;t say ! &quot;
He said , &quot; Your sermons have certainly helped me . &quot;
We &apos;ve had others .
He was a man of tremendous leadership .
He had the favor of God with him .
And in the course of one generation , Israel was completely changed .
There were many problems still left .
Where does it come from ?
How do we solve it ?
But on the other hand , something is wrong .
Now , what causes this ?
And revolutions ?
But he made this statement .
The problem is not technology .
We are a soul .
It &apos;s the part of you that yearns , really , for God .
What &apos;s life all about ? Why am I here ?
What shall I talk to her about ? &quot;
I talk ad lib .
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us .
Yet David again and again said that he would turn to God .
We see people on our screens .
They don &apos;t know that she &apos;s dead .
Or Clark Gable , or whoever it is .
The old stars , they come to life .
But death is inevitable .
About 300 of them were there .
I said , &quot; We &apos;re all going to die .
I &apos;ve talked to them .
Was there a God ?
It passes so fast . &quot;
But it does not need to have to be that way .
On the contrary , they &apos;re sisters . &quot;
I knew Dr. von Braun very well .
And I said , &quot; Sir , I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; So do I. &quot;
Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization .
For Pascal , scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God .
I didn &apos;t make good grades in high school .
One day , I was faced face-to-face with Christ .
Can you imagine that ? &quot; I am the truth .
I &apos;m the embodiment of all truth . &quot;
He was a liar .
Or he was insane .
Or he was what he claimed to be .
Which was he ?
I had to make that decision .
I couldn &apos;t prove it .
Thank you , and God bless all of you .
Thank you for the privilege . It was great .
Richard Wurman : You did it .
Thanks .
Patricia Ryan : Don &apos;t insist on English !
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
I get that all the time in Dubai .
&quot; Here on holiday are you , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Come to visit the children ?
How long are you staying ? &quot;
Well actually , I hope for a while longer yet .
Now that statistic is quite shocking .
A language dies every 14 days .
Could there be a connection ?
Well I don &apos;t know .
Actually , not that long ago .
That is a little bit too early .
Okay .
And why not ?
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who &apos;s a genius .
Well , I don &apos;t think so .
We English teachers reject them all the time .
I don &apos;t think so .
But indeed , that is exactly what we do .
Maybe the barrier would be too universal .
Okay .
&quot; But , &quot; I hear you say , &quot; what about the research ?
It &apos;s all in English . &quot;
It feeds the English requirement .
And so it goes on .
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe .
I love it that we have a global language .
Case in point , Einstein .
Now it &apos;s exploded .
There are lots and lots of tests of English .
So immediately , we &apos;re rejecting them .
It &apos;s a circular thing .
Okay .
But they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
So bingo , problem solved .
If you can &apos;t think a thought , you are stuck .
My daughter came to England from Kuwait .
It &apos;s an Arabic medium school .
Let us celebrate diversity .
Mind your language .
Use it to spread great ideas .
Thank you very much .
Alex Steffen : The shareable future of cities
That shouldn &apos;t be news to any of us .
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species .
And people are embracing this .
Some of it &apos;s transportation access .
This is Google Walking Maps .
Okay . I do too .
Buildings are becoming bundles of services .
So we light our buildings with daylight .
We cool them with breezes . We heat them with sunshine .
This is one way to do it .
So we have visions like this .
We have visions like this . We have visions like this .
Water is energy intensive .
Thank you very much .
My daddy , he calls me all the time . &quot;
&quot; Lucky for you he calls at all , &quot; said Jasmine .
The wisdom lives inside of them .
They were dressed to the nines .
They acted sweet .
They acted silly .
They really enjoyed each other &apos;s company .
It was a huge success .
&quot; Why not ? &quot; the girls asked .
&quot; Because he &apos;s in jail , &quot; she bravely admitted .
&quot; And come in shackles ?
That &apos;s worse than not having him here at all . &quot;
So , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited .
They hugged .
They laughed together .
It was beautiful .
Even the guards cried .
I have had my father in my life always .
He &apos;s even here today .
Dennis vanEngelsdorp : A plea for bees
Now , that &apos;s an awful lot of bees .
Now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous .
We think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
And bees are very faithful .
And of course , they &apos;re made to carry this pollen .
However , honeybees are a minority .
We have bumblebees on the top .
They &apos;re like tiny little flies and they fly around .
Dennis vanEngelsdorp : Bee . Okay , thanks .
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate .
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD .
And if we look at the history of lawns , it &apos;s actually rather tragic .
Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns .
And so we need to rethink this idea .
And I encourage you to look at that .
Danielle de Niese : A flirtatious aria
Eve Ensler : Embrace your inner girl
Namaste . Good morning .
I &apos;m very happy to be here in India .
And I want to call it the girl cell .
And it &apos;s in men as well as in women .
To be a boy really means not to be a girl .
To be a man means not to be a girl .
To be a woman means not to be a girl .
To be strong means not to be a girl .
To be a leader means not to be a girl .
I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo .
For me , it was the turning point of my life .
But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul .
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege .
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women have been raped there .
My mind was so shattered .
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .
And I want to say we &apos;ve annihilated it in men as well as in women .
And I will tell you a very funny story .
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet .
Girls are trained to please .
I want to change the verb .
I want us all to change the verb .
And she was holding her baby .
And I asked her if she loved her baby .
It &apos;s my baby and it &apos;s full of love . &quot;
The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels , to me , is mind-blowing .
Dorcas is 15 years old , and she was trained in self-defense .
They kidnapped her , they put her in a car .
So , for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley .
So , we got her a Jeep . And then she saved 4,500 girls .
And she said , &quot; Well , now , I need a house . &quot;
She has literally become deputy mayor .
She &apos;s changed the rules .
The whole community has bought in to what she &apos;s doing .
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn .
And she knew that meant she would be cut .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t go to school .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t have a future .
She slept with the hyenas . She hid at night .
And when she got to the house she was greeted .
We will not cut you .
And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot;
For me , that is the power of girls .
And that is the power of transformation .
And I want to do it for Sunitha .
This is called &quot; I &apos;m An Emotional Creature . &quot;
It &apos;s all bad . My brothers get everything . &quot;
I &apos;m an emotional creature ! &quot;
I am an emotional creature .
They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears .
I know when a storm is coming .
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air .
I am an emotional creature .
I am an emotional creature .
These feelings make me better .
They make me present . They make me ready . They make me strong .
I am an emotional creature .
There is a particular way of knowing .
It &apos;s like the older women somehow forgot .
Oh , I know when the coconut &apos;s about to fall .
I know we have pushed the Earth too far .
And you know what ? Sometimes it should .
I am an emotional creature .
You don &apos;t tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave .
I am an emotional creature .
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ?
I am your remaining memory .
I can take you back .
Nothing &apos;s been diluted .
Nothing &apos;s leaked out .
Can you say it with me ?
I love , I love , love , love being a girl !
Thank you very much .
Rives : The 4 a.m. mystery
The punch line ?
This is a recent cover of New York Magazine .
A time for inconveniences , mishaps , yearnings .
It is four in the morning . &quot;
They worked until four o &apos;clock in the morning .
And it made me suspicious .
Its title -- &quot; The Palace at Four in the Morning -- 1932 .
Results vary , of course . This is pretty typical .
She has the world &apos;s most absolutely watertight alibi .
100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself .
Coincidence ? No , it &apos;s creepy .
Herbert Powell : Sure , that &apos;s what he &apos;s paid for .
It is Christmas Day , 4 a.m.
There &apos;s a rumble in my stomach .
Marge Simpson : Homer , please .
Rives : Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
Let me see if I got this straight , Matt .
Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs ?
Well , how could it have ?
What happened to William Jefferson Clinton ?
We might not ever know .
It could get awkward , right ?
In generations .
George Dyson : The birth of the computer
This was a perfect introduction .
And it was a technology that was inevitable .
So , it was sort of the right idea at the right time .
He said you needed addition and subtraction .
You could do the whole thing with addition .
And that &apos;s really the simplest computer .
It &apos;s basically why you need the qubit , because it only has two ideas .
The instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail .
That &apos;s where I grew up as a kid .
All these forces came together there , in Princeton .
Oppenheimer , who had built the bomb .
These were the prototype geeks , the nerds .
They didn &apos;t fit in at the Institute .
You can read the text .
This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time .
These were not theoretical physicists .
The input and the output was by teletype tape at first .
This is a wire drive , using bicycle wheels .
Then they switched to a magnetic drum .
And this is the beginning of computer graphics .
&quot; Running time : two minutes . Input , output : 90 minutes . &quot;
This includes a large amount of human error .
What &apos;s code , what &apos;s hardware ?
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK .
&quot; No use , went home . &quot;
Burning lots of midnight oil .
&quot; Code error , machine not guilty . &quot;
&quot; Damn it , I can be just as stubborn as this thing . &quot;
&quot; Master control off . The hell with it . Way off . &quot;
&quot; A short -- do not turn the machine on . &quot;
The high speed was 16 kilocycles .
&quot; I have now duplicated both results .
This now is the third different output .
I know when I &apos;m licked . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ve duplicated errors before . &quot;
&quot; Machine run , fine . Code isn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; Only happens when the machine is running . &quot;
And sometimes things are okay .
So , nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs .
Began -- his universe started March 3 , &apos; 53 .
So it &apos;s almost exactly -- it &apos;s 50 years ago next Tuesday , I guess .
He had a wonderful rapport .
Other people couldn &apos;t get the machine running . It always worked for him .
And he published it . It wasn &apos;t locked up and disappeared .
It was published in the literature .
This is some of the generations of his universe .
They have to have something .
And they did start to evolve .
And he went around the country after that .
And could you do it again now ?
These cards , now , thanks to me showing up , are being saved .
You know , could we get them running ?
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet ?
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening !
It &apos;s a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned .
And we owe a tremendous credit to that .
And that &apos;s the end .
Thank you very much .
Don Norman : 3 ways good design makes you happy
The new me is beauty .
Well , I didn &apos;t have that in mind , so ...
This is neat .
Thank you for setting up my display .
I mean , it &apos;s just wonderful .
And that &apos;s my new life .
The acid will ruin the gold plating .
Beneath it is a wonderful knife .
First of all , look at the shape -- it &apos;s just wonderful to look at .
And third of all , it &apos;s so sharp , it just cuts .
It &apos;s a delight to use .
And so it &apos;s got everything , right ?
It &apos;s beautiful and it &apos;s functional .
And those are the three components .
No . But is it fun ?
Yeah ! Yeah .
Or look at Google .
Instead of saying , &quot; You got 73,000 results .
It &apos;s really simple and subtle .
And it &apos;s just clever .
So , OK .
It was third .
Oh well , different story .
Buy it anyway .
It &apos;s so much fun to drive . &quot;
It &apos;s round , it &apos;s neat .
The controls work wonderfully .
So that &apos;s my new life ; it &apos;s all about fun .
I &apos;m going to put a plank on the ground .
No problem .
Intense fear paralyzes you .
It actually affects the way the brain works .
But it really changes the way you think .
She brought students in to solve problems .
Still can &apos;t reach it .
And , basically , none of them could solve it .
Would you like the box of candy ? &quot;
And guess what -- they solved the problem .
That &apos;s what brainstorming is about , right ?
You &apos;ve got be anxious .
No big deal .
There &apos;s something I call the visceral level of processing , and there will be visceral-level design .
So that &apos;s the visceral level .
It &apos;s all about the visceral experience .
Almost everything we do is subconscious .
Most of what we do is subconscious .
Or the sensual feeling .
It &apos;s a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot .
The water then seeps over the tea .
And when the tea is ready , or almost ready , you tilt it .
On top of that , it communicates , which is what emotion does .
Emotion is all about acting ; emotion is really about acting .
It &apos;s being safe in the world .
It &apos;s kind of neat . What a wonderful design .
It looks over what &apos;s going on .
Or , &quot; Why are you doing that ? I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
Here &apos;s a great reflective product .
But that &apos;s reflective design as well .
But it &apos;s ugly .
This is a clear Don Norman watch .
So , it &apos;s pitting one against the other .
The other neat thing ...
And that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
So that &apos;s the new me .
This first one &apos;s called &quot; the lean . &quot;
&quot; The stretch . &quot;
But the guy , here , on the right , he &apos;s doing the stretch .
to get that device just below the tabletop .
Or , my favorite , the &quot; Love you ; mean it . &quot;
Or , this one , coming to us from India .
That is actually the device .
Look around you .
This one I love .
This is the sound of one hand clapping .
Thank you .
Holding down the right flank of the OECD , all the way on the other side , is Greece .
I grew up in the Midwest of the United States .
Now , how might that be ? Let me give you an example .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to convey so little information .
Actually , no .
You speak English , a futured language .
Now this is a fanciful theory .
But how would you actually go about testing such a theory ?
What is the average difference here ?
Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year .
The survey takes over a day .
What are the characteristics we can control for ?
Does this have cumulative effects ?
Well , think about smoking , for example .
It &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
Thank you very much .
Ken Robinson : Bring on the learning revolution !
And four years later , as I said , it &apos;s been seen by four ...
Well , it &apos;s been downloaded four million times .
... don &apos;t you feel ?
So , as I was saying ...
You see , he &apos;s right .
Jeremy Bentham , the great utilitarian philosopher , once spiked this argument .
Well , I do .
They simply go through their lives getting on with it .
They get no great pleasure from what they do .
And it &apos;s not true of enough people .
it &apos;s still true of a minority of people .
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .
This has to be transformed into something else .
We don &apos;t teach American history in Britain .
We suppress it . You know , this is our policy .
I love that .
Not rise to it , rise with it .
I love that word , &quot; disenthrall . &quot;
You know what it means ?
Now , doing this is easier said than done .
And the reason is that you take it for granted .
How many of you here are over the age of 25 ?
Are there any people here under the age of 25 ?
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches .
They see no reason to do this .
She doesn &apos;t see the point .
As she says , &quot; It &apos;s a single function device . &quot;
&quot; Like , how lame is that ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; No , no , it tells the date as well . &quot;
&quot; It has multiple functions . &quot;
But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
Let me give you a couple of examples .
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college .
Certain sorts of college .
Maybe they go later , not right away .
There was this guy buying a book , he was in his 30s .
And I said , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m a fireman . &quot;
And I said , &quot; How long have you been a fireman ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , when did you decide ? &quot;
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
He said , &quot; I think he thinks better of me now . &quot;
This linearity thing is a problem .
When I arrived in L.A.
No , it doesn &apos;t .
It doesn &apos;t .
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten .
They &apos;re three .
&quot; You &apos;ve achieved nothing -- commit .
Spent the first six months breastfeeding , the way I can see it . &quot;
See , it &apos;s outrageous as a conception , but it &#91; unclear &#93; .
The other big issue is conformity .
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day .
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse .
People have very different aptitudes .
You know , it worked out for Eric , that &apos;s all I &apos;m saying .
In a way , it did not for me .
It just wouldn &apos;t work .
But it &apos;s not only about that .
It &apos;s about passion .
So I think we have to change metaphors .
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development .
There are great ones , like KIPP &apos;s ; it &apos;s a great system .
There are many great models .
That &apos;s where children experience life .
And I wanted to just very quickly ...
And we should tread softly .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Elizabeth Murchison : Fighting a contagious cancer
So first of all , what is a Tasmanian devil ?
She hadn &apos;t eaten for days .
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms .
Of course , they died along with the mother .
Natural selection is survival of the fittest .
It evolves .
The next slide is going to be gruesome .
This is Jonas .
I took these back to the lab .
I extracted DNA from them .
Think about that for a minute .
Well the answer is , it has .
This is Kimbo .
This cancer is remarkable .
It &apos;s a living relic of the distant past .
it &apos;s probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people .
My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer .
Thank you .
Music must be the thing for Derek .
That was the great eureka moment .
Derek Paravicini : I taught myself to play .
DP : &quot; Molly Malone . &quot;
This one is &quot; English Country Garden . &quot;
DP : &quot; English Country Garden . &quot;
AO : There you are .
I think that &apos;s just fantastic .
Basically it was just an exciting journey , really .
Now then .
Etc .
DP : No .
DP : This .
AO : Derek , let &apos;s have a bow .
Well done .
So if I just choose a note at random , like that one .
DP : &quot; Flight of the Bumblebee &quot; on that note .
DP : G minor .
AO : Fantastic . Well done , Derek .
Fantastic chap .
Would you like to hear me play ?
AO : Paganini . DP : &quot; The Theme of Paganini . &quot;
AO : Well done .
DP : Very interesting , Adam , yes . Long-haul flights . Yes .
DP : &quot; Chopsticks . &quot;
AO : A bit like this . DP : Like this . Yes .
He &apos;s sitting there .
DP : Let Derek play it .
AO : What did you do with it , Derek ?
DP : I got to improvise with it , Adam .
AO : This is Derek the musician .
Keep up with Derek .
It &apos;s the great Art Tatum -- DP : Art Tatum .
DP : &quot; Tiger Rag . &quot;
Bjorn Lomborg : Global priorities bigger than climate change
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
There are 800 million people starving .
There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
The lists go on and on .
There are many , many problems out there .
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
Where should we start on solving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated .
To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
Nobody wants to do this .
Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
We have not had an idea .
It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Consensus &apos; process .
So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
Likewise in communicable diseases .
What would be the price ?
And so on .
We called them the &quot; dream team . &quot;
That is what economists do .
They prioritize .
These were the bad projects .
Why is it it came up ?
It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
Yet it would do very little good .
Which is a little good , but not very much good .
And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria .
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
This third best one was free trade .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
That would be the second best investment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
We have , you know , &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; -- it looks great , right ?
It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
I &apos;m all for that .
The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
Thank you .
Any tough problem , I think it can be solved .
Over the past century , average lifespan has more than doubled .
It &apos;s a phenomenal thing .
Well , what &apos;s the history of this disease ?
So it was absolutely gigantic .
And the disease was all over the world .
So it was everywhere .
And two tools helped bring the death rate down .
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT .
And so that &apos;s why the death rate did come down .
So we can see : 1900 , it &apos;s everywhere .
1945 , it &apos;s still most places .
And more recently you can see it &apos;s just around the equator .
Now , baldness , it &apos;s a terrible thing .
And rich men are afflicted .
Now , malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos .
We &apos;ll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit .
Those mosquitos are not infected .
And bed nets are a great tool .
It &apos;s great to see .
And so you end up with two choices .
Now we &apos;re on the upswing .
Bed net funding is up .
There &apos;s new drug discovery going on .
So we &apos;re going to have these new tools .
And the answer is , really , that we don &apos;t .
We all had a wonderful education .
I had great teachers .
In fact , in the United States , the teaching system has worked fairly well .
Not only has that been weak. it &apos;s getting weaker .
And we have to change this .
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school .
For minority kids , it &apos;s over 50 percent .
And that doesn &apos;t seem entirely fair .
So , how do you make education better ?
There &apos;s many people working on it .
What does that mean ?
We should retain those people .
What do they look like ?
And the answer is no .
The variation is very , very small .
One is seniority .
Teach for America : slight effect .
For math teachers majoring in math there &apos;s a measurable effect .
But , overwhelmingly , it &apos;s your past performance .
There are some people who are very good at this .
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power .
It &apos;s an unbelievable thing .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
Everybody needs to be involved .
And so KIPP is doing it .
How does that compare to a normal school ?
The data isn &apos;t gathered .
Of course , digital video is cheap now .
And I thought it was so fantastic .
But I -- I &apos;m optimistic .
I only had time to frame those two problems .
Governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
Thank you .
I will not dance to that beating .
I know that beat .
It is lifeless .
I will not pop , spin , break for you .
I will not kill for you .
Especially I will not die for you .
Everyone can be wrong .
I will not forget where I come from .
I will craft my own drum .
Our humming will be drumming .
I will not be played .
A bunch of pacifists .
Confused , aspiring pacifists .
I understand .
I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
Like a lot .
I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
Poetry does that .
Hold her now with you .
Are you holding her ?
This is &quot; Break Clustered . &quot;
All holy history banned .
Whose son shall it be ?
Which male child will perish a new day ?
Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
We cherish corpses .
We mourn women , complicated .
Bitches get beat daily .
Profits made , prophets ignored .
War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
I live cycles of light and darkness .
Rhythm is half silence .
Sickness , health , tender violence .
I think now I never was pure .
Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
I never was pure .
Girl spoiled before ripened .
Language can &apos;t math me .
I experience exponentially .
Everything is everything .
One woman loses six .
One woman loses her head .
One woman straps herself .
One woman gives birth to a baby .
One woman gives birth to borders .
One woman never did .
Where do refugee hearts go ?
Broken , dissed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
Faced with absence .
We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
My spine curves spiral .
Precipice running to and running from human beings .
Cluster bombs left behind .
De facto landmines .
A smoldering grief .
Harvest contaminated tobacco .
Harvest bombs .
Harvest baby teeth .
Harvest palms , smoke .
Harvest witness , smoke .
Resolutions , smoke .
Salvation , smoke .
Redemption , smoke .
Breathe .
Do not fear what has blown up .
Thank you .
But kites aren &apos;t just toys like this .
It makes you a little nauseous .
And this is where we &apos;re actually going .
So you ask , how big are those machines ?
Well , this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop !
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing .
By 1945 , they were making 100,000 .
I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them .
Thank you .
Matthieu Ricard : The habits of happiness
This is from Marlboro country .
This is a turquoise lake .
A meditator .
They said , &quot; Yes , but it &apos;s summertime . &quot;
So now , we are going to speak of happiness .
We like the ups and downs of life .
Now , let &apos;s come to happiness or well-being .
And that can also come from some kind of confusions .
It is something that -- changes of nature .
That &apos;s the nature of things . We get tired .
I can hear it two , three , five times .
It sort of uses itself as you experience it .
Now , what , then , will be happiness ?
For you , that might be surprising .
Because we are speaking of a different level .
Look at the waves coming here to shore .
You hit the solid rock .
So now , how is that ?
Even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness .
That very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness .
And isn &apos;t that stronger ?
The experience that translates everything is within the mind .
So then , this just needs to have some experience .
There are some which are adverse to this well-being .
And we would like to be like that all the time .
Is change possible in our emotions , in our traits , in our moods ?
That is the ground for mind training .
You could go from love to hate .
So that &apos;s the way to proceed . Rejoicing compared to jealousy .
Benevolence , loving kindness against hatred .
Look at anger itself .
So this is the principal of mind training .
With loving kindness , with patience , with openness ?
Now , here with 256 electrodes .
It deals with the state of compassion , unconditional compassion .
Hopefully , they will come .
Like the startle experiments , for example .
We love to do jogging , fitness .
We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful .
And jumping monks of Tibet .
Flying monks .
Thank you very much .
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
I &apos;ve always been fascinated with knowing the self .
We &apos;ve cluttered ourselves up with all this .
It &apos;s really only a successful escape .
Think of the term we use , &quot; Retreat . &quot;
It means we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
I say the answer is yes .
It &apos;s called thought-controlled computing .
Let me show you what it looks like .
That blue line there is my brainwave .
By the way , feel free to check in on my head at any time .
We were transcending the space between the mind and the device .
So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool .
And that was responsiveness .
When you read , the desk lamp would get brighter .
That you could know something about yourself .
So you use it with your headset .
The more you focus , the faster the rotation .
This is for real .
This is not a fake .
I like to call this &quot; intra-active . &quot;
Normally we think about technology as interactive .
This technology is intra-active .
This can be as effective as Ritalin .
Would you get a divorce ?
Thank you .
Graham Hill : Less stuff , more happiness
What &apos;s in the box ?
Sound familiar ?
Three times .
Nope .
So where does this lead ?
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft .
Three main approaches .
First of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
We &apos;ve got to clear the arteries of our lives .
It &apos;s time for me to let it go .
We need to think before we buy .
By all means , we should buy and own some great stuff .
We want space efficiency .
And of course , my own movie theater .
Go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
Would that give me a little more freedom ?
Maybe a little more time ? &quot;
What &apos;s in the box ?
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
I know I don &apos;t need it .
What &apos;s in yours ?
So let &apos;s make room for the good stuff .
Thank you .
I loved statistics from a young age .
And I studied very much in Sweden .
But I will start with a historical background .
I will start at 1858 .
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination .
The size of the bubble here is the population .
And I also bring an innovation here .
And we will see , you know .
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it starts to move there ?
And Japan is trying to move up there .
United Kingdom is going down .
And now comes the Spanish flu also .
Not much has happened .
But they did recover quite fast afterwards .
And we are moving into the new world .
In 1947 India finally gained its independence .
And what happened ?
Children started to go to school .
Health services were provided .
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung .
And they were catching up indeed .
And the market reformer was successful there .
In &apos; 92 India follows with a market reform .
This is the big question today .
Shanghai is already there .
Washington , D.C. went out here .
It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
We have an enormous disparity in the world .
Now , back to my projections .
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer .
But independence is coming here .
Growth is starting , economic reform .
Look at , look at the United States .
Can you see the bubble ?
I can compare to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
We add Japan to it .
Can be worse , can be better .
But what I &apos;m really worried about is war .
Carl Schoonover : How to look inside the brain
This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain .
It &apos;s a diagram of the visual system .
And some things look very familiar today .
You really would be kind of out of luck .
It &apos;s gray , formless .
And this all changed in the late 19th century .
The computer was cracked open .
And it works in a very particular way .
It clears the forest , reveals the trees inside .
And there &apos;s several ways of doing this .
They have great explanatory power .
Thank you .
So what is a drone ?
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra .
Recently , we &apos;ve also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras .
We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland .
The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters .
It is a fully autonomous system .
And in a way , they are right .
Thank you .
Anthony Atala : Printing a human kidney
The fact is that we &apos;re living longer .
So this is now a public health crisis .
It really involves many different areas .
Or we can use both .
We can use , actually , biomaterials and the cells together .
And that &apos;s where the field is today .
But it &apos;s actually not a new field .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Culture of Organs . &quot;
The first author , Alexis Carrel , a Nobel Prize winner .
And that really has to do to many different challenges .
The second challenge was cells .
We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body .
Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells .
Plus we have stem cells .
So we can actually use biomaterials now .
This is actually a biomaterial .
This is actually like a cotton candy machine .
You saw the spray going in .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did here .
We can also use cells alone .
These are actually cells that we obtained .
So they know what to do .
So that &apos;s actually now in patients .
We then put it in this oven-like device .
Another technology that we &apos;ve used is actually that of printing .
And then finally you &apos;re able to get that structure out .
You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it .
That &apos;s what you see here on the right side .
This is how it actually works .
We &apos;re also working on more sophisticated printers .
This actually shows the actual printer .
And this actually shows that printing .
In fact , we actually have the printer right here .
Put a pair of gloves here .
Thank you .
Go backwards .
Has a little bit of consistency to it .
Thank you , Dr. Kang . I appreciate it .
So this is actually a new generation .
And this is actually a new technology we &apos;re working on now .
I felt so sick .
I was able to do more things .
I was able to wrestle in high school .
Luke , come up please .
LM : Well right now I &apos;m in college at the University of Connecticut .
I pulled them aside .
Thank you so much .
JE : Thank you , Tony .
Tom Shannon , John Hockenberry : The painter and the pendulum
And I did one that was about 35 feet long .
TS : Those are permanent magnets , yeah .
TS : Yeah .
It &apos;s really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
JH : I agree .
My sculptures are normally very simplified .
JH : And they &apos;re non-deterministic .
TS : No .
But then I started dreaming of having six colors .
JH : Thanks guys .
JH : Whoa . That is ...
ooh , nice .
TS : So something like this .
JH : That &apos;s fantastic .
JH : So many forces there .
Like the occurrence of moire patterns .
It &apos;s really manifested there .
There are lots of things that appear .
Oh , please , yes . Oh , I &apos;m so there .
Is that relevant to your work ?
I mean , I &apos;ve got the symptoms .
I &apos;m left-handed , and so I draw .
You don &apos;t think of yourself as the master of these forces .
You think of yourself as the servant .
It just has so much in it .
And we are expressions of the universe , basically .
It &apos;s a terrific studio assistant .
TS : Thank you , John .
Moshe Safdie : How to reinvent the apartment building
We traveled the country .
Those who have no choice lived there .
There has to be another way of doing this .
It &apos;s a very desirable place to live in .
In 1973 , I made my first trip to China .
It was the Cultural Revolution .
We traveled the country , met with architects and planners .
Shenzhen didn &apos;t even exist as a city .
There were hardly any cars .
Thirty years later , this is Beijing today .
This is Hong Kong .
Could we make it more affordable ?
And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan .
It &apos;s permeable .
That &apos;s measured in the winter solstice .
And Colombo .
Thank you .
Good morning .
But we do not know his face .
So , what do you think ?
Let &apos;s find out .
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him .
But no faces ?
I find that hard to believe .
So let &apos;s try to find them .
There are about 120 , you see them here .
Which ones of these could be self-portraits ?
So we can eliminate all the profiles .
It also has to be sufficiently detailed .
And here they are .
OK , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
Now , are they made in the right order ?
The young man should be made first .
They are made in the right order .
What was the age of Leonardo at the time ? Does that fit ?
Well , we need a reference .
The icon of icons finally has a face .
Here he is : Leonardo da Vinci .
And I did .
It &apos;s unaffordable globally .
This is a portable ultrasound .
All right , I gotta gel up .
And actually , can you see Libby ?
Thomas Batuik : Hi there , Eric .
You look busy . How are you ?
Okay , that &apos;s good . How about up a little bit ?
Should I do that again ?
TB : Yeah , let &apos;s do that .
This was me in third grade .
Now the software is also getting smarter , right ?
And I have these palpitations that are showing up .
I had a care coordination problem .
And this happens to millions of people every year .
I wept the day I graduated .
And here &apos;s the most important part .
That &apos;s the only way that the model works .
Tracey Gamley : For me , it was really easy .
I only had one night in the hospital .
Dennis Hong : My seven species of robot
So , the first robot to talk about is called STriDER .
But before that , let &apos;s look at pop culture .
But my robot , STriDER , does not move like this .
So , this is an actual dynamic simulation animation .
We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion .
potential energy to kinetic energy , potential energy to kinetic energy .
It &apos;s a constantly falling process .
What you see over here , this is what we want to do next .
So we have two prototypes .
The first version , in the back , that &apos;s STriDER I.
The one in front , the smaller , is STriDER II .
It &apos;s a mechanical solution to a problem , instead of using mechatronics .
The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS .
We are literally re-inventing the wheel here .
Let me demonstrate how it works .
You probably haven &apos;t seen anything like this out there .
Ah , isn &apos;t that cool ?
The front wheels rotate like this .
We just simply change the length of the spoke .
So , this is CLIMBeR .
We developed our adaptive gait planner .
And also , it does some fun stuff , as can imagine .
We get so many visitors visiting our lab .
This robot is an amoeba robot .
So , this is some of the early feasibility experiments .
Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments .
There are a lot of really neat , very good robotic hands out there in the market .
The problem is they &apos;re just too expensive , tens of thousands of dollars .
And it can actually crush an empty soda can .
The best part , it took only $ 200 dollars to make the first prototype .
This is a robot that can climb structures .
This is a HyDRAS &apos;s arm .
It &apos;s a 12 degrees of freedom robotic arm .
But the cool part is the user interface .
The cable over there , that &apos;s an optical fiber .
Now , this robot is currently our star robot .
This was in 2004 ; at that time , this was something really , really revolutionary .
So , this does not have any sensors .
So , it &apos;s an open loop control .
And thus , DARwIn I was born in 2005 .
It stands up , it walks -- very impressive .
So , in 2006 , now it &apos;s really time to have fun .
And now DARwIn II is completely autonomous .
It is not remote controlled .
Dennis Hong : So , there is actually a competition called RoboCup .
I don &apos;t know how many of you have heard about RoboCup .
So , this is last year in China .
This is this year in Austria .
There you go . Yes !
The robots track and they team play amongst themselves .
Louis Vuitton Cup trophy .
Thank you .
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents .
I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion , martial art movements . &quot;
And it walks away . So , this is DARwIn IV .
And again , you &apos;ll be able to see it in the lobby .
So , what is the secret of our success ?
Where do we come up with these ideas ?
So , really , we have five secrets .
First is : Where do we get inspiration ?
Where do we get this spark of imagination ?
This is a true story , my personal story .
And they assemble , and they form these kinds of mechanisms .
And then I think , &quot; Ah this is cool . &quot;
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
Nobody criticizes any opinion .
And this is how we develop our ideas .
Well , actually , there are two sides to the story .
Math , differential equations .
These are all the tools that we need .
So , education is very important .
There you go . Thank you so much .
Mikko Hypponen : Fighting viruses , defending the net
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
So let me show you something .
This here is Brain .
And we actually know where Brain came from .
We know because it says so inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
Now , 1986 .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And I knocked on the door .
You want to guess who opened the door ?
Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
So here standing up is Basit .
Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
So where are all these coming from then ?
It &apos;s gangs like -- let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
Same thing with every single password and so on .
And that , obviously , is a problem .
They are both right now on the run .
Nobody knows where they are .
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
How do you actually track them down ?
Let me give you an example .
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
But just keep staring at it .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
So obviously I Googled for it .
I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
And he drives a very nice car .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blogged about the car .
He actually had a car accident .
But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
And this is what runs our infrastructure .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
Everything is being run by computers .
Everything is reliant on these computers working .
Thank you very much .
Rogier van der Heide : Why light needs darkness
Well that was not by me .
That was , of course , by Le Corbusier , the famous architect .
So this is how we normally would light our offices .
What it all boils down to is , of course , the sun .
The sun is for dynamics , for color changes .
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you .
So you begin with focal glow .
Ambient luminescence is something very different .
And we can only create these out of darkness .
And I will explain that further .
Maybe in the airplane , we can overcome jet lag like that .
And you can imagine a lot more applications .
And it is all about this planet .
But when you look at this planet at night , it looks like this .
Because all this light here goes up to the sky .
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for .
It never is to the benefit of people .
It only spoils the darkness .
So at a global scale , it looks like this .
How do they share their culture ?
And how can light help there ?
So here it is .
And I will very quickly show you how it works .
So just to explain .
Now , every LED that is made these days gives blue light .
Now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .
And for that reason , we cover the LED with a phosphor cap .
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light .
Thank you .
We can go further .
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities .
Why are all these motorways permanently lit ?
Is it really needed ?
Can we be more gentle with light ?
And can we preserve the darkness ?
They are not disturbed anymore .
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting .
Where have they come from ? Where are they going ?
We can do that in commercial spaces like this .
In architecture , it works just the same .
Thank you very much .
And I am illustrating Still .
So this takes care of my age .
This was about 1925 .
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum .
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale .
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself .
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years .
I call myself a maker of things .
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work .
The work as an apprentice was very primitive .
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing .
And there I really worked as an apprentice .
I said , I also have a pottery .
I remember that it was quite successful .
And that was in Hamburg .
This was my first job .
Eva Zeisel : Are you sure ?
Moderator : Yes , I am sure .
This was a very dangerous accusation .
Weren &apos;t you there recently ?
Here I am now , if this is the end ? Thank you .
Bonnie Bassler : How bacteria &quot; talk &quot;
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth .
You have about 30,000 genes .
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well .
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
When it &apos;s alone it doesn &apos;t make any light .
The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology .
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .
That &apos;s how it works .
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule .
This is the word that it talks with .
So these are private , secret conversations .
It &apos;s a very small , five-carbon molecule .
This is the bacterial Esperanto .
Couldn &apos;t these be new kinds of antibiotics ?
The first one is we &apos;ve targeted the intraspecies communication system .
We &apos;ve also done the same thing with the pink system .
This is exactly what happens in your body .
Science is done by that demographic .
Thanks .
Richard Baraniuk : The birth of the open-source learning revolution
I &apos;m Rich Baraniuk .
Does anybody remember these ?
I &apos;m here to talk about books .
Has anyone here ever been to school ?
So , imagine taking all the world &apos;s books .
Think of it as a massive iTunes for book type content .
In fact , this dream is actually being realized .
So , that &apos;s sort of to put it in perspective here .
So , create . So what are some of the people that are using these kind of tools ?
Tremendous , tremendous use .
What about copying , reusing , right ?
OK , burn , I think this is sort of , quite interesting .
A little present for you .
It &apos;s about 300 pages long , hardbound .
This costs , anybody guess ?
How much would it cost in a bookstore ?
Audience : 65 dollars .
Why does it cost 22 dollars ?
We &apos;re not talking about the Harry Potter end , right at the left side .
OK , so what are the enablers ?
What &apos;s really making all of this happen ?
How many people know about XML ?
Oh , great , so it &apos;s the future of the web , right ?
The same type of mark-up , like mathML , for chemistry .
Even the three wise men .
It &apos;s now owned , right , much of it by big industries .
And the ideas , the creative commons licenses .
How many people have heard of creative commons ?
We &apos;re not talking about Harry Potter , right ?
We &apos;re at the long tail end here .
So I &apos;d like to conclude with just the last few points .
How do we protect it into the future ?
So that could be a problem .
OK , you come to TED . Why do you come to TED ?
So , thanks very much .
Sam Martin : Claim your &quot; manspace &quot;
It had everything I needed . It was quiet .
So I did some research .
And I found that there was an historic precedence .
Hemingway had his writing space .
But on the inside , it &apos;s anything but .
And this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
And he found the scoreboard in the trash .
Here &apos;s another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated .
The guy did it all himself .
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside .
There were definitely hang-out spots .
Take this place for example .
This is in Long Island , New York .
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window .
It has no nails or screws .
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed .
And so there is a good reason for this .
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough .
It &apos;s made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship .
Museum quality .
And they were unexpected and they were surprising .
And they really loved their professions .
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies .
Thank you very much .
Stefon Harris : There are no mistakes on the bandstand
Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
It is really a sacred space .
Every &quot; mistake &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
If you played an E.
And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
And we won &apos;t react to it .
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
It was an opportunity that was missed .
So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
So you see , he played this note .
The texture changed in the drums this time .
So there is no mistake .
It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
This is a science of listening .
Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
Thank you .
One is the Thylacine Project .
We &apos;ve lost a whole family .
I &apos;d like it back .
The second reason is that we killed these things .
Okay . Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project .
They thought , this is incredible .
It was extinct .
Well , we looked at the tissue under the microscope .
It actually didn &apos;t look bad . The cell walls looked intact .
So we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that .
That was a miracle , but it was workable .
Thank you .
But it &apos;s also a tragic history .
We found marsupial lions .
We found carnivorous kangaroos .
And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either .
They were eating the same kinds of foods .
That was not what happened , actually .
Have a look at this bit of film footage .
Does it have to stay this way ?
In 1990 , I was in the Australian Museum .
Cloning was science fiction . It had not happened .
But then suddenly cloning did happen .
I put a team together .
We were very excited .
So we got it .
Okay . What could we do with this stuff ?
It has to be a different species .
Is this a risk ?
You know , some kind of weird hybrid chimera ?
And the answer is no .
This is a key question for everybody .
He led them around on a rope .
We &apos;d all love to have this sort of thing happen .
He looked at the hut . We went inside .
The grasslands were sweeping away .
So could we put it back ? Yes .
We need other parallel strategies coming online .
And this one interests me .
And I &apos;m positive it wouldn &apos;t .
We need to think about this in today &apos;s world .
Thank you .
Okay , so most of you are .
Right ?
For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
The answer is that it comes from how we farm .
We use fertilizers in our farming , chemical fertilizers .
Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture ?
So , what does a plant need in order to grow ?
So , the plant &apos;s roots will extract these resources .
Why phosphorus in particular ?
DNA is our genetic heritage .
Now , where do we find this phosphorus ?
As humans , where do we find it ?
Some are happier than others .
Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers .
Let me explain .
A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used , but only 15 percent goes to the plant .
You &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s wasteful .
Yes , it is . What is worse is that it is very expensive .
Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost .
Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus .
Now , where will we get this phosphorus from ?
Basically , we get it out of mines .
So that really puts it into perspective .
So , we get phosphorus from mines .
To come back to the oil problem , oil is something we can replace .
This graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today .
The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves .
In 2030 , we &apos;ll reach the peak .
By the end of this century , it will all be gone .
The dotted line shows where we are today .
Do we have a solution ?
Less and less phosphorus will be available .
What should we do ?
It truly is a paradoxical situation .
Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots .
This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza .
Normally , a root will find phosphorus all by itself .
Beyond one millimeter , the root is ineffective .
It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus .
Now , imagine this tiny , microscopic mushroom .
True symbiosis .
A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil .
That &apos;s completely natural .
The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms .
These are trials in a field of sorghum .
This is to show you that this method works .
This is an example of soy production in Canada .
Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other .
The problem is that people are not aware of it .
I &apos;m passionate about this topic .
Thank you for your attention .
William Ury : The walk from &quot; no &quot; to &quot; yes &quot;
Well three sons got into a negotiation .
Seventeen doesn &apos;t divide by two .
It doesn &apos;t divide by three .
It doesn &apos;t divide by nine .
Brotherly tempers started to get strained .
So then they had 18 camels .
The first son took his half -- half of 18 is nine .
You get 17 .
They had one camel left over .
They gave it back to the wise old woman .
We &apos;re all one family .
That &apos;s the question .
It &apos;s actually surprisingly simple .
It &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s simple .
It &apos;s not even new .
The secret to peace is us .
That system , I call the &quot; third side . &quot;
And we can play an incredibly constructive role .
It &apos;s very easy to react .
Human beings -- we &apos;re reaction machines .
And so the third side reminds us of that .
There was a war going on , as you know .
The conversation got back on track .
How could we possibly go to the balcony ?
Let me just ask you one question first .
Just out of curiosity , how many of you ?
Okay , so the great majority of us .
And here , it &apos;s so far away .
Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict ?
Is it the number of deaths ?
Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge .
They give meaning to our lives .
That &apos;s what we tell here at TED , we tell stories .
Stories are the key .
Let &apos;s try to get at the root of what it &apos;s all about .
Let &apos;s see if we can apply the third side to it .
What &apos;s the origin story of the Middle East ?
That man , of course , was Abraham .
He &apos;s the father of us all .
So in that sense , he &apos;s the symbolic third side of the Middle East .
Today we face the scourge of terrorism .
What is terrorism ?
What &apos;s the opposite of terrorism ?
How would you bring that story to life ?
And that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham .
Because walking has a real power .
Who fights while they walk ?
People said , &quot; That &apos;s crazy . You can &apos;t .
You &apos;ve got to cross all these borders .
And so we studied the idea at Harvard .
We did our due diligence .
Let me ask you a question .
That &apos;s the essence of the Abraham path .
&quot; In the name of father Abraham , let me offer you some food . &quot;
He &apos;s alive ; he &apos;s a living presence .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
It was Abraham Path Day .
The media love it ; they really adore it .
It brought us hope .
And so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
She &apos;s desperately poor .
They sit on the floor .
She doesn &apos;t even have a tablecloth .
That &apos;s the potential of the Abraham path .
The potential is basically to change the game .
Let me just show you one thing .
What would the oak tree look like ?
It &apos;s not easy , of course , but it &apos;s possible .
It was done in South Africa .
It was done in Northern Ireland .
It could be done anywhere .
It simply depends on us .
It depends on us taking the third side .
We &apos;re about to take a break in a moment .
That &apos;s a third side act .
That &apos;s walking Abraham &apos;s path .
So let me just leave you with three things .
One is , the secret to peace is the third side .
The third side is us .
Thank you very much .
The first of these is politics .
That second red line is religion .
Audience : Sex .
Shereen El Feki : Louder , I can &apos;t hear you .
Audience : Sex .
SEF : Again , please don &apos;t be shy .
Audience : Sex .
SEF : Absolutely , that &apos;s right , it &apos;s sex .
Marriage is your ticket to adulthood .
Faiza was living proof of this .
Her virginity statement was not a piece of wishful thinking .
Only she became pregnant all the same .
Sadly , Faiza is not alone .
But the man , he is still at the prehistoric stage . &quot;
Hot stuff !
no matter where we live and love .
Thank you .
iO Tillett Wright : Fifty shades of gay
What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been divorced ?
What are you into ? Who are you into ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
The boxes are too narrow .
And this can get really dangerous .
I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
I mean , who knows , right ?
When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
I kept up the charade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
No one is exactly shocked .
I was not an activist .
I wave no flags in my own life .
It might give them pause .
And I took those photographs , and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help .
And then we made this .
It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
There is no equality in the United States .
I want to take the project across the country .
Visibility really is key .
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
Can you quantify your openness ?
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
Thank you .
I just wanted you to know that .
It &apos;s been around for about 7,000 years .
They didn &apos;t know exactly what they were doing .
Not much has changed , by the way .
But this was common .
We can turn it up or down , on or off .
So this looks something like this .
The electrodes are turned off now , and you can see that she has tremor .
We &apos;re now going to turn it on .
It &apos;s on . Just turned it on .
And this works like that , instantly .
We want you to stop doing that . &quot;
And we do that with electricity .
There are eight children in the family .
Five of them have dystonia .
So here he is .
So he is one of five kids .
He did not respond to any drugs .
We did not know what to do with this boy .
It is the sadness center of the brain .
And so patients with depression have hyperactivity .
The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot .
Anybody interested in that ?
Of course we can , right ?
Now we &apos;re not going to do this in normal people .
They shut down . They turn off .
These areas of the brain are shut down .
The lights are out in these areas of the brain .
So this is now in clinical trials .
We can now reach those circuits .
We can introduce electrodes within those circuits .
We can graduate the activity of those circuits .
Thank you very much .
Damon Horowitz : Philosophy in prison
Meet Tony . He &apos;s my student .
There &apos;s the punk on the ground , puddle of blood .
&quot; What are you going to teach me about right and wrong ?
I know what is wrong . I have done wrong .
You think you know right and wrong ?
Then can you tell me what wrong is ?
No , don &apos;t just give me an example .
What is that idea ?
What makes something wrong ?
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
We are here for knowledge .
And something changes for Tony .
&quot; Could be I &apos;m wrong . I &apos;m tired of being wrong .
I want to know what is wrong .
I want to know what I know . &quot;
What can creatures like us know of such things ?
Socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
Turns out , Tony &apos;s got the philosophy muscle .
That &apos;s Plato , Descartes , Nietzsche and Bill Clinton .
Let us think about that . &quot;
And I say to Tony , &quot; Let &apos;s do this . &quot;
Thank you .
First , of course , the economic meltdown .
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve .
Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone .
We believe in risk awareness .
What does that mean ?
Not a complicated thing .
We care how we make our profit .
It was also about a business opportunity .
Will government change ?
Like TED , I believe in people .
Women in Iceland took the day off .
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance .
Thank you .
Kate Hartman : The art of wearable communication
My name is Kate Hartman .
And it &apos;s pretty simple .
Everybody &apos;s got one -- all of you .
Don &apos;t be ashamed .
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat .
It physically carves out conversation space for one .
What kind of an experience do they have ?
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener .
And I thought , &quot; Well , hey !
Because there seems to be an issue .
The glaciers are actually leaving us .
There &apos;s no kind of social protocol for this .
Do I carve a message in the snow ?
So , yea , this is actually just the beginning .
These are initial musings for this project .
Thanks .
We are always chasing storms .
We want to see and measure storms -- brainstorms , that is .
We are doing a thousand now .
You can put it louder if you can .
And Aurora liked to play video games .
Think about that .
And to our shock , that &apos;s exactly what Aurora did .
She played the game without moving her body .
Well , we did that 10 years ago .
Just fast forward 10 years .
And that &apos;s exactly what they do .
The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets .
And he &apos;s sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain .
And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward .
The brain is assimilating that too , as fast as we can measure .
How far can we take it ?
So where are we taking all this ?
Thank you .
Lisa Margonelli : The political chemistry of oil
The napalm is burning there quite nicely .
So this is what happens as that burn gets going .
It takes off . It &apos;s a big woosh .
It &apos;ll just bake your retinas .
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil .
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules .
Then there &apos;s all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon .
Those are called the asphaltenes ; they &apos;re an ingredient in asphalt .
They &apos;re very important in oil spills .
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .
Oil doesn &apos;t sink , it floats .
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .
It also makes it very viscous .
It &apos;s incredibly hard to clean up .
I am helpless over this . &quot;
And that &apos;s actually very perverse .
It is green . It is a shrine to greenishness .
And we get kind of in on our own con .
I mean -- and this is funny , it looks funny here .
Okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States .
It &apos;s the &quot; Beverly Hillbillies , &quot; basically .
And then , of course , there was John D. Rockefeller .
There were no lips .
Okay , so that guy is actually still with us .
And then there &apos;s this guy , okay .
So I &apos;m saying this is kind of a distraction .
You have these pictures of birds .
They really influence people .
It started Earth Day .
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period .
And we have this kind of -- as voters , we have kind of a &quot; eureka ! &quot; moment .
In fact , it &apos;s continued to increase .
I was there in 2003 .
It &apos;s become this intense industrialized zone .
And finally , American families also pay a price for oil .
What are the laws ? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused ?
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater .
We need to stay away from the moratoriums .
We need to focus really back again on the molecules .
We need to focus on reducing the oil .
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies .
We need to have more mobility choices .
They &apos;re up at NewAmerica.net.
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work .
So you &apos;re not helpless at the pump .
That &apos;s a lot .
So , three million barrels a day .
Thank you .
Ludwick Marishane : A bath without water
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
Now we need to get this thing into practice .
At least once a week .
What &apos;s stopping you ?
I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
David Steindl-Rast : Want to be happy ? Be grateful
In this , we are all together .
Now my topic is gratefulness .
How is the connection between happiness and gratefulness ?
Many people would say , well , that &apos;s very easy .
When you are happy , you are grateful .
But think again .
Is it really the happy people that are grateful ?
Why ? Because they are grateful .
So it is not happiness that makes us grateful .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes us happy .
If you think it &apos;s happiness that makes you grateful , think again .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes you happy .
And how does it work ?
I appeal to your own experience .
We all know from experience how it goes .
Something is given to us that &apos;s valuable to us .
And it &apos;s really given .
These two things have to come together .
You haven &apos;t bought it . You haven &apos;t earned it .
We cannot only have grateful experiences .
We can be people who live gratefully .
And how can we live gratefully ?
Well , think again .
Moment by moment , we can be grateful for this gift .
Certainly not .
We cannot be grateful for violence , for war , for oppression , for exploitation .
It isn &apos;t as bad as it might seem .
Learning patience , for instance .
That takes patience . That &apos;s difficult .
That &apos;s an opportunity that is given to us .
They make something out of life .
We always get another opportunity .
That &apos;s the wonderful richness of life .
How can we do it ?
It &apos;s a very simple method .
Stop . Look . Go .
That &apos;s all .
But how often do we stop ?
We miss the opportunity because we don &apos;t stop .
We have to stop . We have to get quiet .
And we have to build stop signs into our lives .
In Africa where I was , I didn &apos;t have drinkable water .
Every time I turned on the faucet , I was overwhelmed .
But after a while , this wears off .
So leave it up to your own imagination .
And when you stop , then the next thing is to look .
You look . You open your eyes .
You open your ears . You open your nose .
Thank you .
Julian Treasure : Shh ! Sound health in 8 steps
They work even when you sleep .
Ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
And yet it &apos;s a skill that none of us are taught .
Here are two of them .
Reductive listening is listening &quot; for . &quot;
Men typically listen reductively .
So he &apos;s saying , &quot; I &apos;ve got this problem . &quot;
He &apos;s saying , &quot; Here &apos;s your solution . Thanks very much . Next . &quot;
That &apos;s the way we talk , right guys ?
Women typically listen expansively .
The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise , surrounding us all the time .
It &apos;s a really big problem .
It looks a bit like this .
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression .
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music .
There is a cost of compression .
You &apos;re having to imagine it .
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
Now that &apos;s a really serious problem .
Protect your ears in that way .
Silence is beautiful .
It &apos;s fun to get into designing with sound .
Sound healing is a wonderful modality .
It &apos;s been around for thousands of years .
I do urge you to explore this .
Devotional music , good -- Mozart , good .
There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy .
First of all , listen consciously .
Musicians have bigger brains -- it &apos;s true .
You can do this in groups as well .
And let &apos;s take a stewarding role for the sound around us .
Protect your ears ? Yes , absolutely .
So I urge you to take that path .
I wish you sound health .
Not like that .
And this isn &apos;t just found in packaging .
And that &apos;s not the only place it &apos;s found .
They &apos;re not biologically compatible .
You &apos;ll find it inside of you .
The first is feedstocks .
Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years .
This is crazy .
But nature provides us with a really good model here .
And this gets us back to the mushrooms .
Because in nature , mushrooms are the recycling system .
We then process these husks with some basic equipment .
So what you &apos;re seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas , in this case .
It &apos;s a waste product .
Because the manufacturing process is our organism .
So I &apos;ve said a number of times that we grow materials .
It actually takes a little longer . It takes five days .
But it &apos;s much faster than conventional farming .
The last step , of course , is application .
In this case , we &apos;ve grown a corner block .
So , why mycelium ?
The first reason is local open feedstocks .
You don &apos;t need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility .
Biological yield is really important .
And I think that can be some really good news .
Thank you .
Nirmalya Kumar : India &apos;s invisible innovation
They laughed . They dismissed us .
They said , &quot; You know what ? Indians don &apos;t do innovation . &quot;
You must have gotten your education here . &quot;
Process innovation is different from product innovation .
Here is the profile of employees of IBM over the last decade .
It gives you a sense of the trend .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much .
Jody Williams : A realistic vision for world peace
I know there have been many challenges made to people .
Peace is not &quot; Kumbaya , my Lord . &quot;
I think of meditation .
This is called human security .
And I &apos;m trying harder and harder .
Mom , I &apos;m really trying .
I certainly support the START vote .
In global terms , it &apos;s a little bit of money .
It is saving the tigers .
It is stopping the tar sands .
It is all of those things .
It is about action .
I said , &quot; Yes , Your Holiness .
Your robe gives it away . &quot;
I said , &quot; That &apos;s good . That &apos;s good .
We need that in the world .
I don &apos;t follow that , but that &apos;s cool . &quot;
I think what we need is action . &quot;
But I talked to her for a range of issues .
She has been in exile for the last year and a half .
She says the airports of the world .
Wangari Maathai -- 2004 Peace laureate .
Working for peace is very creative .
It &apos;s hard work every day .
Working together is what changes our world .
There was a mother and three children .
The children were killed on the spot .
It was Mairead &apos;s sister .
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum .
She also received the Peace Prize .
She is now running for president .
They could maybe volunteer that much .
It &apos;s not a dirty word .
It &apos;s hard work every single day .
Thank you .
Toni Griffin : A new vision for rebuilding Detroit
They came to Detroit for a better way of life .
Between 1950 and 2000 , the region grows by 30 percent .
Citywide , there are 80,000 vacant homes .
They can also see vacant property .
Citywide , there are about 100,000 vacant parcels .
So the city is 139 square miles .
So it &apos;s a lot of vacancy .
Three key imperatives were really important to our work .
Thank you .
Anil Ananthaswamy : What it takes to do extreme astrophysics
And that feeling hasn &apos;t left me yet .
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world .
This is Lake Baikal .
The lake is entirely frozen .
And they have dedicated their lives to it .
It &apos;s very harsh conditions .
They work on a shoestring budget .
And it &apos;s that basic , but they do this every year .
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
An extraordinary set of telescopes .
Here &apos;s another view of the same .
Finally , I want to take you to Antarctica .
This is cosmology &apos;s final frontier .
And here we are about to board our bus .
And that &apos;s taking us to McMurdo .
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo .
It &apos;s an extraordinary place .
And that process takes about two hours .
The fabric alone weighs two tons .
In order to minimize the weight , it &apos;s very thin , it &apos;s as thin as a sandwich wrapper .
And I would like to share with you a launch .
Anil Ananthaswamy : And I &apos;ll finally like to leave you with two images .
And on the far left there is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery .
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery .
And both require silence of some sort .
Thank you .
Steven Johnson : Where good ideas come from
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford .
You would be sharper and more alert .
What &apos;s the kind of environmental -- what is the space of creativity ?
It &apos;s a new configuration that has never formed before .
So , the technology is there .
There &apos;s a Toyota Forerunner on the street in all these places .
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working .
And this is what they ended up coming with .
It &apos;s called a &quot; neonurture device . &quot;
In the inside , it &apos;s all car parts .
That &apos;s really where innovation happens .
I mean , this is one vision of it .
This is a statue from Oxford .
And &quot; oh , eureka , &quot; they &apos;ve got the idea .
So they want to tell the story of the &quot; eureka ! &quot; moment .
Darwin is a great example of this .
That &apos;s in his autobiography .
It will be useful in 2020 .
But that &apos;s a key thing .
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach .
We could probably hear it , if we tune in . &quot;
That &apos;s an interesting idea . &quot;
So they made it really easy to find it .
We should record it . &quot;
That &apos;s pretty cool . &quot;
Could you go the other way ?
So they went back , and they thought about it .
And he said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s great .
Could you work on that problem ? &quot;
And that &apos;s how GPS was born .
That is how innovation happens .
Chance favors the connected mind .
Thank you very much .
Pattie Maes + Pranav Mistry : Meet the SixthSense interaction
But I would say no .
The system tracks the four significant fingers .
The device is completely portable , and can be ...
So one important difference is that it &apos;s totally mobile .
He can ask for additional information .
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated .
This is a more controversial one .
In this case , the student is interested in cameras , etc .
Thank you .
Harald Haas : Wireless data from every light bulb
And these are base stations .
These are cellular mobile phones .
And one of the issues is capacity .
And radio waves are limited .
And we are simply running out of spectrum .
There &apos;s another problem .
That is efficiency .
And that creates a big problem .
Then there &apos;s another issue that you &apos;re all aware of .
You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights .
In hospitals , they are security issues .
And security is another issue .
These radio waves penetrate through walls .
So these are the main four issues .
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
X-rays , useful when you go to hospitals .
Then there &apos;s ultraviolet light .
So it &apos;s inherently safe to use .
And guess what ?
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already .
So we have the infrastructure there .
Go to the main floor , you see these light bulbs .
Can we use them for communications ?
Yes .
What do we need to do ?
And it has a very nice acute property .
So let &apos;s show how we do that .
Not usable for a YouTube video .
And the technology we have developed -- it &apos;s called SIM OFDM .
But not only that .
And the light goes through that hole .
There &apos;s a receiver .
So what happens when I switch on that light ?
As you would expect , it &apos;s a light , a desk lamp .
Put your book beneath it and you can read .
It &apos;s illuminating the space .
You &apos;re critical .
You think , &quot; Ha , ha , ha .
This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here . &quot;
But let me do this .
Once again .
Still don &apos;t believe ?
You don &apos;t notice with your human eye .
And the answer is yes .
So I &apos;ve mentioned to you the four challenges .
That &apos;s aside .
And then I &apos;ve mentioned the availability .
You need to see what to do .
You have lights in an aircraft .
So it &apos;s everywhere in a day there is light .
It has a flashlight , an LED flashlight .
And then there &apos;s security .
And there &apos;s only data where there is light .
So the data goes in that direction , not there anymore .
Now we can in fact see where the data is going to .
But I can give you a few examples .
Well you may see the impact already now .
This is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
And they use light to illuminate space down there .
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on .
And then we have these aircraft cabins .
Online life . So that is a vision , I think , that is possible .
Thank you .
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow ?
About 200 times usually .
And there is probably a better way to do this .
This is it .
Our standard see-through patient .
We can do multiple passes through that same entry .
No robots required .
And played around with this a little bit .
And our team members developed this technology .
And eventually we got two large animals , and pig studies .
This device was just FDA approved in the last year .
You all know about embryonic stem cells .
Thanks .
Marco Tempest : A cyber-magic card trick like no other
So these are my illusion glasses .
They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
All right . Very significant mark .
Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
There are 13 cards in each suit .
MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
Make a wish .
Wake up .
Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh !
I &apos;m performing for you .
Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
Whoa .
Well , to this , I just say , no no .
Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein .
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
MT : Bye bye .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Nancy Lublin : Texting that saves lives
I think it might be a lifeline .
I think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin .
I can help you with those later .
It might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
And the secret is she opens every single one .
Texting has a 100 percent open rate .
Now the parents are really alarmed .
We &apos;re finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
We &apos;ve been getting text messages back like these .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
The boys call me faggot . &quot;
But I just started again an hour ago . &quot;
Or , &quot; He won &apos;t stop raping me .
He told me not to tell anyone .
It &apos;s my dad . Are you there ? &quot;
And yeah , we &apos;re there .
Because this isn &apos;t what we do .
We do social change .
It &apos;s fast , it &apos;s pretty private .
It &apos;s real time .
That &apos;s great .
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
I want to prevent this shit from happening .
So think about a cop .
There &apos;s something in New York City .
And then they started crime mapping .
Or maybe there &apos;s some anecdotal evidence .
You could inform legislation .
You could inform school policy .
Thank you .
Phil Hansen : Embrace the shake
This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist .
I was making all these scribble pictures .
Embrace the shake .
It was destroyed before it ever existed .
It did not happen overnight .
And what if I didn &apos;t embrace the shake ?
It turned out to be about life , and having life skills .
Thank you .
Kelly McGonigal : How to make stress your friend
Anyone ?
How about a moderate amount of stress ?
Who has experienced a lot of stress ?
Yeah . Me too .
But that is not my confession .
Basically , I &apos;ve turned stress into the enemy .
Okay . Some bad news first .
That is over 20,000 deaths a year .
It &apos;s called the social stress test .
Now we &apos;re going to all do this together .
It &apos;s going to be fun .
For me .
as fast as you can , starting with 996 .
Go !
Audience : Go faster . Faster please .
You &apos;re going too slow .
Stop . Stop , stop , stop .
That guy made a mistake .
We are going to have to start all over again .
You &apos;re not very good at this , are you ?
That pounding heart is preparing you for action .
If you &apos;re breathing faster , it &apos;s no problem .
It &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
I want to make you better at stress .
And we just did a little intervention .
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone .
It fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
It enhances your empathy .
It &apos;s a stress hormone .
Well , oxytocin doesn &apos;t only act on your brain .
It &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
Caring created resilience .
Stress gives us access to our hearts .
Thank you .
This is kind of amazing , what you &apos;re telling us .
Thank you so much , Kelly . It &apos;s pretty cool . KM : Thank you .
Rory Sutherland : Perspective is everything
It &apos;s really , really tiring .
Generally the first dog can be relatively content .
It &apos;s an interesting question .
Because they are actually the same thing .
I think that &apos;s true actually .
We didn &apos;t have a framework .
And I think that &apos;s probably right .
But this does not apply the other way around .
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay .
Which isn &apos;t a great idea .
It &apos;s an innate thing called goal dilution .
Don &apos;t give them 24 white pills .
It &apos;s called chunking .
This is a toll crossing in Britain .
Sometimes you get very , very severe queues .
It could revolutionize the public services .
It could really change things quite significantly .
I think they &apos;re right .
Von Mises completely rejected this distinction .
And he used this following analogy .
Try this quick thought experiment .
That &apos;s pretty good .
But I &apos;m British , that &apos;s the way we like it .
Thank you very much .
Elif Shafak : The politics of fiction
I &apos;m a storyteller .
A week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
It will dry up inside .
We all do .
I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
My mother became a diplomat .
I started writing fiction in English .
So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
And that gap is very intimidating .
And because God loves her , I did get married .
But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
I asked him what he meant by that .
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
It was only because of our passports .
A function is attributed to fiction .
It comes from everywhere .
It was just a story .
One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
The other , in nuances .
One draws boundaries .
The other recognizes no frontiers .
Fiction is flowing water .
Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
Literature has to take us beyond .
Like that , my fiction as well .
It &apos;s between buildings .
I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
Thank you .
Naturally 7 : A full-band beatbox
We &apos;re ready to fly ! Thank you very much .
Chris Bliss : Comedy is translation
And it &apos;s a charming read .
So no ego problems .
And that &apos;s when I discovered comedy .
The description perfectly captured Edwards &apos; personal vanity .
And guess what ?
His intent is to be funny .
Now let me give you an example from my act .
Three things I &apos;ve tried to avoid my entire life .
Why is this remotely controversial ?
You have given birth to an abomination .
Remove it from your household .
And this isn &apos;t some new phenomenon of our wired world .
And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy .
So we started talking about climate change .
You &apos;ve got to love that idea .
And this cartoon hit the bull &apos;s eye .
And it didn &apos;t stop there .
Thank you .
Sheikha Al Mayassa : Globalizing the local , localizing the global
Qatar is no exception to the region .
Her answer was quite the contrary .
Not that you do ; I &apos;m just saying .
We know that modernization is happening .
And yes , Qatar wants to be a modern nation .
I &apos;m a representation of that phenomenon .
And guess what ?
I want to ask you , why do you think this is ?
No , I don &apos;t think so .
Ask me .
Ask the chairpersons and CEOs of Sotheby &apos;s and Christie &apos;s .
Ask Charles Saatchi about great art .
They make a lot of money .
We don &apos;t want to have what there is in the West .
We don &apos;t want their collections .
For me it was a new discovery .
In a similar way , we have created the Doha Film Institute .
Boy : Hey listen ! Did you know that the stocks are up ?
Who are you playing ?
Khaled : Why would I want to put it on ?
Girl : Do as you &apos;re told , young girl .
Boy : No , you play mom and I play dad .
Play by yourself then .
Girl : Women ! One word and they get upset .
Useless .
Thank you . Thank you !
It &apos;s important for two things .
We should not underestimate it .
This is a very interesting journey .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much . Shokran .
Christopher &quot; moot &quot; Poole &quot; : The case for anonymity online
Tom Green : That &apos;s a 4chan thing .
It &apos;s a video game move from &quot; Star Fox . &quot;
&quot; Star Fox 20 &quot; ?
I got to tell you , it &apos;s driving me nuts , actually .
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream , &quot; 4chan ! &quot;
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard .
And we &apos;ve gone from one board to 48 boards .
This is what it looks like .
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site .
Rule one is you don &apos;t talk about / b / .
Two is you do not talk about / b / .
And I will spare you that slide .
I assure you , it is very true .
It is where a third of all the traffic is going .
And so , you know , 390 percent approval rating ain &apos;t so bad .
So they broke that poll .
And I ended up on top .
I ended up at this really fancy party .
But that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet .
They are still protesting .
Dusty is the name that we &apos;ve given to this cat .
As I said , it &apos;s raw , it &apos;s unfiltered .
We &apos;re moving towards persistent identity .
We &apos;re moving towards , you know , a lack of privacy , really .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Got a couple questions for you .
Don &apos;t tell .
CP : Yes and no .
There are plenty of downsides .
CP : There are , certainly .
CP : Yeah , I posted a thread on Sunday .
99 percent of it is just , would have been , you know , bleeped out .
But there were some good things that came out of that too .
Love and peace were mentioned .
CP : Cats and dogs were mentioned too .
Right , it &apos;s gone ? Or is it still up there ?
CP : I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days .
Okay , well .
What &apos;s the commercial picture here ?
CP : The commercial picture is that there really isn &apos;t much of one , I guess .
The site has adult content on it .
But you still live at home , right ?
CP : I actually moved out recently .
That &apos;s very cool .
CP : At first , very kind of pained , awkward conversations .
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
CP : That &apos;s a good question .
Matt Ridley : When ideas have sex
The population explosion was unstoppable .
Global famine was inevitable .
The acid rain was falling on the forests .
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
Per-capita food production is up by a third .
How did we achieve that ?
These are both real objects .
The other is obviously a computer mouse .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
They &apos;ve come together .
How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
It &apos;s a unique human feature .
No other animal does it .
You can have culture without exchange .
You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
And why does exchange raise living standards ?
Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own spears and axes .
So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc .
How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
And the answer is about half a second .
It was self-sufficiency .
We call that poverty these days .
How many other people ?
Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
The queen does it all .
In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
So when did this habit start ?
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
They were a highly cooperative species .
They were a highly intelligent species .
They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
They &apos;re always made from local chert .
Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
And that will have led to specialization .
An example is Tasmania .
The Tasmanians were isolated .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
Nobody , literally nobody .
I mean this quite seriously .
The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to run a company .
We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
However , bad things happen .
Thank you .
Honor Harger : A history of the universe in sound
Space , we all know what it looks like .
This is the planet Jupiter .
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy .
So Thomas Watson wasn &apos;t listening to us .
We didn &apos;t have the technology to transmit .
So what were these strange noises ?
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .
Let &apos;s jump ahead again .
It &apos;s 1964 , and we &apos;re back at Bell Labs .
There was a glitch in their soundtrack .
There were pigeons roosting in the dish .
But the noise didn &apos;t disappear .
Thanks .
Now , extinction is a different kind of death .
It &apos;s bigger .
Suddenly it wasn &apos;t here at all .
What happened ?
Well , commercial hunting happened .
There &apos;s an upside to the story .
It was hunted to death for its feathers .
It happened to lots of mammals .
The extinctions still go on .
It went extinct in 2000 .
Sorrow , anger , mourning .
Don &apos;t mourn . Organize .
It &apos;s kind of like an evolution machine .
It &apos;s called an allele .
Now , there &apos;s work to do .
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter .
So this meeting in Boston led to three things .
We hired him full-time .
De-extinction falls in that category .
Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical .
Another amazing story came from Alberto Fernández-Arias .
It was the first de-extinction in history .
It was short-lived .
Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems .
Since it &apos;s so pluripotent , it can become germ plasm .
So what do you do about that ?
Here &apos;s a couple related examples .
Everybody thought is was finished .
There were just 254 left .
The secret is , they have an eco-tourism program , which is absolutely brilliant .
There &apos;s no breeding pairs left .
A bit of cloning , you can get them back .
So where do we go from here ?
These have been private meetings so far .
What do people think about it ?
Do you want extinct species back ?
Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down .
What are they concerned about ?
We &apos;re also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve got a question .
There &apos;s going to be unintended consequences .
We will get woolly mammoths back .
Thank you so much for presenting . SB : Thank you .
Thank you .
Tan Le : A headset that reads your brainwaves
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals .
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .
Now on to the detection algorithms .
Evan . Okay .
He just hangs out . He &apos;s relaxed .
Evan Grant : Let &apos;s do &quot; pull . &quot;
Tan Le : Okay , so let &apos;s choose &quot; pull . &quot;
But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds .
So : one , two , three , go .
Okay .
So once we accept this , the cube is live .
Ah , good job !
That &apos;s really amazing .
This is &quot; disappear . &quot;
Same sort of drill . So : one , two , three , go .
Okay . Let &apos;s try that .
Oh , my goodness . He &apos;s just too good .
Let &apos;s try that again .
EG : Losing concentration .
As there is a machine learning algorithm in this -- Thank you .
Good job . Good job .
Now blink left to turn back left .
Now smile to go straight .
TL : We really -- Thank you .
Madeleine Albright : This is &quot; Breaking the Glass Ceiling . &quot;
PM : Oh .
So that &apos;s how it all started .
PM : So how large is the collection ?
Pretty big .
It &apos;s now traveling .
PM : So is this a good idea .
Go out and look like a diplomat . &quot;
and so how did you handle that ?
So it evolved .
and &quot; will I really say something intelligent ? &quot;
And all of a sudden I thought , &quot; Well , wait a minute .
Only girls are Secretary of State . &quot;
PM : Because in her lifetime -- That would be so .
PM : What a change that is .
Where are we ?
From some people .
The women in Bosnia were being raped .
Now there are 192 .
PM : Is that &quot; Girl 7 ? &quot; Girl 7 .
And so it was nice when one of them would show up .
And it was really terrific .
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me .
More women &apos;s voices at the table ?
Thank you for joining us today .
Thank you all . Thanks Pat .
Eric Giler : A demo of wireless electricity
The other thing is , we love batteries .
We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States . &quot;
Wires suck , they really do .
The other thing is , batteries suck too .
And they really , really do .
40 billion of these things built .
This is what happens .
Think about that .
And nature really does abhor a vacuum .
So how does it work ?
Number one question I get asked .
You know . What about safety ?
The first thing is this is not a &quot; radiative &quot; technology .
It doesn &apos;t radiate .
There aren &apos;t electric fields here . It &apos;s a magnetic field .
We live in a magnetic field .
And it &apos;s virtually impossible in nature to make that happen .
Mobile electronics .
Home electronics .
There are industrial applications .
And then finally , electric vehicles .
But who is going to want to plug them in ?
Credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
You &apos;ve got a coil .
We put one on the back of the television set .
So , I &apos;ll plug that in .
It creates a magnetic field here .
How many people want to hang them on the wall ?
So , I wanted to show you something .
This a Google G1 .
It runs the Android operating system .
It &apos;s odd . It has a battery .
And Nokia as well .
But they typically use it to light up the screen .
So , thank you very much .
We &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
We &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
What frightens you ? &quot;
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently .
So I will spend a little time at the end .
It &apos;s not clear what the target should be .
But there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that number .
Should it be 450 ? Should it be 400 ?
There &apos;s not a lot of science behind that one either .
Now , why is this so complicated ?
There &apos;s air-sea interactions .
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .
That changes our climate .
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
It &apos;s a scientific drilling vessel .
It looks downright tropical there .
Most of the time it looked like this .
We had a waves up to 50 ft .
It &apos;s the ANDRILL project .
And we drilled in the Ross Sea .
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about .
Here &apos;s the cartoon on the left there .
It took about 10 years to put this project together .
And here &apos;s what we found .
That &apos;s the kind of material in the deep sea .
So we know there &apos;s an ice shelf overhead .
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this .
This is absolutely beautiful stuff .
And this is in the past four million years .
This was completely unexpected .
What caused it ?
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted .
And you know what ?
And it could be larger than that .
Okay , the second story takes place here in Galapagos .
This is from Champion Island .
It &apos;s about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony .
Here &apos;s how we sample the corals .
This coral is eight meters tall , right .
And it been growing for about 600 years .
So we have a diamond drill .
I &apos;ll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands .
Imagine that .
Each one of those is a year .
And we just count on down to the bottom .
Their ratio tells us the water temperature .
The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
Here &apos;s a synthetic diagram .
We do similar things with ice cores .
We work with tree rings .
This is as messy as it gets .
You can see there &apos;s some signals there .
And there &apos;s the temperature up there in 2009 .
And as it does so , it makes the ocean more acidic .
So , you cannot argue with that .
It has many consequences .
There &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
Thank you very much .
John Underkoffler : Pointing to the future of UI
The interface is the OS .
So it was a necessity .
Same thing for processor speeds .
So we &apos;ve got that incredible ramp-up .
So we &apos;ve forgotten to invent new interfaces .
They don &apos;t understand real world space .
That &apos;s a digital storage in a physical container .
Here , the real world merges with the simulation .
And we make the machine meet them half way .
That &apos;s 8 a.m. shadows .
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m.
There you are , swinging the sun around .
Short shadows at noon and so forth .
And we built up a series of tools like this .
This work is 15 years old .
And that &apos;s all well and good .
We can fly around them .
So navigation is a fundamental issue .
You have to be able to navigate in 3D .
We can organize it this way .
Let &apos;s just come down a bit and fly around .
So that &apos;s a different way to look at stuff .
Here are some selection planes .
So , from there to the world of real work .
There &apos;re a lot of elements .
So here &apos;s a familiar place .
And we &apos;ll bring this back here for a second .
Maybe select a little bit of that .
And bring out this graph .
Well , that doesn &apos;t really cut it anymore .
And we might want to look at these various images .
We might want to ask for some help .
These are unrelated machines , right ?
So let me get some of these out of the way .
Kevin , can you help ?
All right .
And let &apos;s just pick out a few elements .
We can zip through them as a possibility .
We may need more than one .
Yeah , let &apos;s take that one .
And , as well , as of efficacy , agency .
So I will leave you with that . Thank you .
JU : No , it has to be for every human being .
That &apos;s our goal entirely .
I mean it &apos;s been 25 years .
You know , how can it work ?
It &apos;ll be built into architecture .
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years .
So this is the inevitability about it .
Well that &apos;s cool .
What do you think , what in your mind is the first killer app for this ?
And I understand what you &apos;re asking .
C &apos;mon , c &apos;mon . Martial arts , games . C &apos;mon .
JU : It &apos;s been a great pleasure .
Thank you to you all .
Caroline Casey : Looking past limits
Do you know what I wanted to be ?
I wanted to be a biker chick .
I am , and have been since birth , legally blind .
I might buy some more time .
Hey .
See this hand ?
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline .
And every woman , you are so beautiful .
No special needs schools .
No labels .
No limitations .
My ability and my potential .
But very quickly I recovered . It was like that .
And I believed I could do it .
And then I went to business school .
And you know , disabled people are hugely educated .
And they didn &apos;t even know .
And it &apos;s extraordinary how far belief can take you .
Wonderfully , my eyes decided , enough .
I was 28 years old .
And I simply said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t see , and I need help . &quot;
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult .
And it &apos;s frightening , isn &apos;t it ?
But all that belief had fueled me so long .
Can I tell you , airports are a disaster .
Oh , for the love of God .
And please , any designers out there ?
I always end up in the gents &apos; toilets .
It &apos;s such a small thing , right ?
I had no idea who I was anymore .
God no , it was therapy .
And do you love what you do , Caroline ? &quot;
To leave would be failure .
And he said , &quot; Do you love it ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t even speak I was so choked up .
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time .
He thought I was mad enough anyway .
And that door closed .
And my chest ached .
But I did know the game was up .
Really not a very sensible thing to do .
I always run it perfectly fine .
And there was a rock that I always missed .
And I &apos;d never fallen on it , never .
And I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Because who am I going to be ?
What am I going to be ? &quot;
I had lost my belief .
Look where my belief had brought me to .
I was crumpled .
Do something different . What do you want to be ?
Do something different . What do you want to be ? &quot;
And really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened .
And it did happen this way .
&quot; Well , how about Mowgli from &apos; The Jungle Book &apos; ?
You don &apos;t get more different than that . &quot;
And nobody can tell me no .
Yes , you can say I can &apos;t be an archeologist .
I know how to be Mowgli .
I &apos;m going to go across India on the back of an elephant .
I &apos;m going to be an elephant handler . &quot;
From global management consultant to elephant handler .
But I knew I would .
Six thousand people got to see because of that .
I chucked in my job at Accenture .
It was extraordinary .
That &apos;s what I wanted to do .
It just seemed that it was possible .
Even though I present confident , I was scared .
He said , &quot; Be you . &quot;
And so here I am .
This is me , all of me .
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom .
I simply needed vision and belief .
I no longer want anybody to be invisible .
We all have to be included .
And stop with the labels , the limiting .
We are extraordinary , different , wonderful people .
Thank you .
Sam Richards : A radical experiment in empathy
How can I understand those invisible forces ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; Empathy .
Start with empathy .
It all begins with empathy .
Here , I &apos;ll give you an example .
And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so .
This is what I saw .
And then I asked myself the question .
Does this sound familiar ?
And back in China , what do they say in China ?
I mean , come on , I &apos;m not going to turn down my thermostat .
You can &apos;t expect that . &quot;
And we fight back , and it gets really ugly .
And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way .
And just imagine what you would feel .
And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear .
And you &apos;ve got to feel that .
Okay , so that &apos;s the warm up .
That &apos;s the warm up .
Now we &apos;re going to have the real radical experiment .
You want your kids to have a better life .
That &apos;s what you want .
You &apos;re Arab Muslim living in Iraq .
You want a better life for yourself .
So here , let me help you .
It &apos;s your land ; it &apos;s your resource .
Somebody else has a design for it .
And you know why they have a design ?
You know why they have their eyes set on it ?
And what else do you think about these people ?
The Americans , they &apos;re rich .
And back home , what do you see ?
Poverty , despair , struggle .
Look , you don &apos;t live in a wealthy country .
This is Iraq .
This is what you see .
You see people struggling to get by .
And you feel something about this .
It &apos;s part of your life .
And you talk about it with your friends .
You read about it .
That &apos;s odd .
You can &apos;t help but think that .
You talk about it .
It &apos;s in the forefront of your mind always .
You say , &quot; How is that possible ? &quot;
Once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly , pain and sorrow .
But there &apos;s something else .
And what do you see ? They &apos;re Christians .
They &apos;re Christians .
Why ?
And you feel something about that -- of course you do .
And they do wonderful things .
You read about it , you hear about it .
And this guy , you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin .
They don &apos;t know anything about him , but you do .
I mean this is serious . You &apos;re afraid .
Man , the Americans , they &apos;re just like , &quot; Ah , crusade .
Whatever . I don &apos;t know . &quot;
You know what it means .
It &apos;s a holy war against Muslims .
If they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
That &apos;s what this is about .
This is frightening .
You feel frightened . Of course you feel frightened .
They laugh him off . You don &apos;t laugh him off .
Because in the context of everything else , all the pieces fit .
These Christians , who are these Christians ?
Of course you &apos;re going to think this .
You &apos;ve got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp .
These Christians are nuts .
And go to the website .
It says &quot; U.S. Army &quot; right on it .
And you &apos;re reading this website .
You don &apos;t know that .
For you , this is like all Christians .
It &apos;s all over the Web , Bible Boot Camp .
Isn &apos;t that interesting .
And it scares you , and it frightens you .
So these guys , you see them .
They &apos;re my students , my friends .
I know what they &apos;re thinking : &quot; You don &apos;t know . &quot;
That &apos;s what they are to you .
So here .
Of course , you got it wrong .
You &apos;re generalizing . It &apos;s wrong .
You don &apos;t understand the Americans .
It &apos;s not a Christian invasion .
You have it wrong . You &apos;ve missed it .
Of course you don &apos;t . Very few people do .
But some of you do .
And this is a perspective .
Okay , so now , here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
So everyone &apos;s back in the room , okay .
Now here comes the radical experiment .
So we &apos;re all back home .
I feel her .
She &apos;s anybody to me .
So here &apos;s what I want you to do .
Let &apos;s go back to my first example of the Chinese .
So I want you to go there .
What do you think about that scene ?
Okay , try this . Bring it back .
This is the scene here .
And so I &apos;m going to invite you to take a risk with me .
These gentlemen here , they &apos;re insurgents .
They were caught by the American soldiers , trying to kill Americans .
And maybe they succeeded . Maybe they succeeded .
Can you feel the rage ?
Can you go there ?
It shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
You just -- oh , man .
Now , put yourself in their shoes .
Which one ?
Can you imagine that ?
Can you imagine saying that ?
Can you go there ?
What do you think they &apos;re feeling ?
You see , that &apos;s empathy .
It &apos;s also understanding .
And I say , because ... because .
You &apos;re allowed to hate these people .
Whatever it is , you can go so far .
And then do it again and do it again and do it again .
And they build a big , complex world .
Everything has changed .
Everything in your life has changed .
And that &apos;s , of course , what this is about .
Attend to other lives , other visions .
Listen to other people , enlighten ourselves .
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do too .
Thank you .
Robin Ince : Science versus wonder ?
I do a radio show .
The radio show is called &quot; The Infinite Monkey Cage . &quot;
It &apos;s about science , it &apos;s about rationalism .
We know this because they did an experiment . &quot;
That &apos;s what I do .
That is gone .
This is a wonderful thing .
That is a wonderful idea .
But it &apos;s not gone .
Science actually says we will live forever .
Well , there is one proviso .
That is a good thing .
We are all totally recyclable .
This is a wonderful thing .
And that is a wonderful thing there .
Love does not die because of that thing .
Pain doesn &apos;t go away either .
No , I just spit out a tooth .
I have a son . His name is Archie .
Now I know you don &apos;t think that .
Now in many ways , that &apos;s just a survival thing .
That is a wonderful thing .
I &apos;ve done some tests .
You house is in a terrible state .
Your partner is about to return .
You think , what should I do ?
Do nothing .
That &apos;s the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming .
For me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
I &apos;m sitting on a train .
I &apos;m sitting on a chair .
I &apos;m glad the universe is pointless .
That &apos;s not the point . &quot;
I can make my own purpose .
You can make your own purpose .
Thank you very much . Goodbye .
The 404 page is that .
It &apos;s that broken experience on the Web .
And it serves you the 404 page .
It &apos;s inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it .
Because it &apos;s the feeling of a broken relationship .
Yes .
But these things are everywhere .
They &apos;re on sites big , they &apos;re on sites small .
This is a global experience .
A 404 page is not what you &apos;re looking for .
You get that , and it &apos;s like a slap in the face .
And you say , &quot; Hey , could you bring the skim milk ? &quot;
That &apos;s the 404 feeling .
I mean , I &apos;ve heard about that .
Joey !
Crowd : Whoa !
So this turned into a contest .
Each one of them found this .
It turned into a 24-hour contest .
This is one that commiserates with you .
This is one that blames you .
This is one that I loved .
Thank you .
So what &apos;s a good definition for cyborg ?
People aren &apos;t supposed to be there .
What does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self .
And I said , &quot; Great . &quot;
I thought I was very clever .
He said , &quot; No , no , no . Here &apos;s a better way . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Dad , dad , dad , how do you do that ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I want to do that . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , okay . &quot;
And I want to make a time machine . &quot;
So I started studying anthropology .
And I thought , &quot; Oh , wow . I found it . This is great . &quot;
They &apos;re not just sitting there .
And so this is very important .
It actually looks very organic .
And it &apos;s not that machines are taking over .
Thank you .
How had I spent my valuable time ?
How could this have gone by like lightning ?
And then my mother died at 82 .
And I &apos;m not in the present whatsoever .
It was deep in my imagination .
It &apos;s daunting .
It &apos;s more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean .
And I started to train .
It &apos;s a smiling face .
And I put together an expedition .
The navigation is difficult .
It &apos;s tricky .
And there &apos;s dehydration .
And there &apos;s hypothermia .
And there are sharks .
And there are all kinds of problems .
Are your shoulders ready ?
And they were . They were prepared .
No stone left unturned .
Was the mind ready ?
You save the French for last .
And it &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
And I couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
Is there an edge ?
And I knew I could do it .
And I started swimming , and , oh my God , it was glassy .
First of all , you &apos;re going to hit obstacles .
It &apos;s not going to feel this good all the way across .
You &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
Your body doesn &apos;t like the saltwater .
And I &apos;m yelling out , &quot; Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire !
Help me ! Somebody help me ! &quot;
And the next thing is paralysis .
Then come convulsions .
He &apos;s stung .
And he &apos;s saying , &quot; Bonnie , I think I &apos;m going to die .
I need help , and I can &apos;t help Diana . &quot;
So that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
It was like an ICU unit in the water .
They either die or they quickly get to a hospital .
And the next night at dusk , again , wham !
And I gave in to the staged swim .
And I got back in .
And I swam through that night and into the next day .
And the dream was crushed .
I &apos;ll just swim right through them .
Well there was no grin and bearing this .
And they do this wrapping .
And they can send the poison into the system .
And I said , &quot; What &apos;s your name ? &quot; &quot; Henry . &quot;
&quot; Henry , what &apos;s your question ? &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s what you need .
I said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s like a suicide army . &quot;
I finished the swim like this .
I was swimming with this thing on .
That &apos;s how scared of the jellyfish I was .
So now what do I do ?
Because we &apos;ve all had them , haven &apos;t we ?
We &apos;ve all had a heartache .
Yeah .
Thank you .
But that ocean &apos;s still there .
This hope is still alive .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And so , what after that ?
Are you going to swim the Atlantic ?
No , that &apos;s the last swim .
It &apos;s the only swim I &apos;m interested in .
But I &apos;m ready .
I said , &quot; Nope . I didn &apos;t know . &quot;
And now I &apos;m going to live to 85 .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Live it large . Live it large .
Liza Donnelly : Drawing on humor for change
I was afraid of womanhood .
I &apos;ve learned to be flexible .
Let me explain .
There were plenty of role models all around us .
Now my mother was different .
And I just ate it up .
I was launched as a cartoonist .
We &apos;re told what shape we &apos;re supposed to be in .
We pass it down from generation to generation .
Humor relies on the traditions of a society .
It takes what we know , and it twists it .
I think you can get change .
Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos .
It didn &apos;t work .
My parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested .
But I found my place .
I can &apos;t help it . I live here .
Consequently , we have .
We have amazing antennae .
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them .
Thank you .
Jeff Skoll : My journey into movies that matter
You &apos;ve got a cruel sense of humor , TED .
It &apos;s a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability .
And I think that &apos;s just a horrible thing .
I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14 .
So I set out in a hurry . I studied engineering .
And needless to say , I was right .
Bet on good people doing good things . &quot;
And that really resonated with me .
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today .
And then of course , there was the other adage .
We want them to actually get involved in the issues .
And much to my surprise , they were noticed .
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy .
It was also a pretty good year for this guy .
And for Participant , this is just the start .
I &apos;ll quickly talk about a few coming up .
It &apos;s been a real honor . Thank you .
Oh , thank you .
Sebastian Wernicke : 1000 TEDTalks , 6 words
I think we have a situation here .
How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas ?
And I did a little calculation of this .
Here &apos;s my approach to it all .
Isn &apos;t there something shorter ?
Or &quot; Living in existential vacuum ; it sucks . &quot;
I actually like that one .
I mean ...
So I thought this was quite worthwhile .
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars .
I would cut my costs by 90 percent .
He always proves us wrong .
They just had some general comment .
There were others , and I found this quite cheeky .
Here are some of my favorites .
Or happiness : &quot; Striving toward happiness = moving toward unhappiness . &quot;
So here I was .
It &apos;s a huge list .
Again , there were some misunderstandings .
I mean that &apos;s the essence of it all .
So I had 50 overall summaries done .
Thank you very much .
Underwater astonishments
Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
Tough thing to do .
In the next bit , we &apos;re going to see a couple squid .
And the male ... We &apos;re going to see it again .
But they can do pretty amazing things , too .
Disappears right into the background .
Positively amazing . Here &apos;s two males fighting .
That &apos;s an amazing thing .
Here &apos;s some algae in the foreground ...
Watch the skin color ; watch the skin texture .
One , two , three .
Theo Jansen : My creations , a new form of life
Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution .
Evolution has generated many species .
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa .
I could show you this animal .
Thank you .
There are 11 numbers , which I call the 11 holy numbers .
In fact , it &apos;s a new invention of the wheel .
It works the same as a wheel .
It &apos;s 3.2 tons .
Can I have the feeler here ?
OK . Good .
And it must feel the water of the sea .
And this is the water feeler .
Here , we have the brain of the animal .
It &apos;s a binary step counter .
Thank you .
I still have to help them a lot .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
Remarkably -- no , miraculously -- he lived .
And that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
It gets way better .
Thank you .
Pankaj Ghemawat : Actually , the world isn &apos;t flat
So let &apos;s start off with plain old telephone service .
The answer turns out to be two percent .
Or let &apos;s turn to people moving across borders .
Turns out to be a little bit higher .
It &apos;s actually about three percent .
Not quite ten percent .
So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide .
Okay .
A couple of different reasons come to mind .
A second reason has to do with peer pressure .
The perspective was , here is this poor professor .
The answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent .
Which brings me to my second point .
Bono : The good news on poverty
I said , &quot; Chris , that would take a miracle . &quot;
So , yeah .
And the Pharaoh replies , &quot; Oh , no .
You , your miserableness , have got to be kidding . &quot;
This time it &apos;s called the Facebook .
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square .
So exit the rock star .
Look at what &apos;s been achieved .
Wow . Wow .
This fantastic news didn &apos;t happen by itself .
Give it up for that .
Halved . Halved .
There &apos;s still work to do .
This is everything .
Can &apos;t be true , can it ?
We do love a good baseline .
That &apos;s amazing .
There are all kinds of benefits to this .
How about that ?
And 2028 , 2030 ? It &apos;s just around the corner .
I hope . I &apos;m hoping .
Makes us look really young .
So why aren &apos;t we jumping up and down about this ?
Well , the opportunity is real , but so is the jeopardy .
Look at this graph .
And the next one is really beautiful .
It &apos;s called momentum .
So inertia versus momentum .
But you can do something about that .
You can do something about that too .
But there &apos;s a vaccine for that too .
And technology is really turbocharging this .
This is exciting stuff .
It &apos;s transformational .
It &apos;s not going to kill you .
In fact , it could save countless lives .
I &apos;m thinking of Wael Ghonim , though .
&quot; We are going to win because we don &apos;t understand politics .
Wael is right .
Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Jason Fried : Why work doesn &apos;t happen at work
But let &apos;s , sort of , start at the beginning .
And so these companies , they build offices .
It seems like it &apos;s perfectly reasonable to ask that .
Typically you get three different kinds of answers .
So here &apos;s some examples .
You almost never hear someone say the office .
What is that about ?
Why is that ?
Why is that happening ?
That &apos;s what happens at the office .
Then you have something else to do .
I mean , we &apos;ve all been through this .
I was at work .
I used the software they told me to use .
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to .
I did these conference calls . I did all this stuff .
But I didn &apos;t actually do anything .
I just did tasks .
I didn &apos;t actually get meaningful work done .
How about seven hours ?
Six ? Five ? Four ?
Two hours ? One , maybe ?
That &apos;s not really what I mean .
I don &apos;t think anyone would say yes .
That doesn &apos;t really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me .
And I &apos;m one of these managers .
&quot; I can &apos;t let someone work at home .
They &apos;ll watch TV . They &apos;ll do this other thing . &quot;
Because those are voluntary distractions .
So let &apos;s go through a couple of those .
I mean , is this China ? What the hell is going on here ?
That &apos;s kind of ridiculous . It &apos;s a total decoy .
Those aren &apos;t the real problems in the office .
That &apos;s kind of bad .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
I don &apos;t care what you &apos;re doing .
Just , you &apos;ve got to stop doing what you &apos;re doing , so you can have this meeting . &quot;
I mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
What if they &apos;re thinking about something important ?
What if they &apos;re doing important work ?
Because meetings aren &apos;t work .
But meetings also procreate .
You don &apos;t schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook .
These things don &apos;t exist outside of the office .
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation .
I have three suggestions I &apos;ll share with you guys .
I have about three minutes , so that &apos;ll fit perfectly .
We &apos;ve all heard of the casual Friday thing .
I don &apos;t know if people still do that .
But how about &quot; no-talk Thursdays ? &quot;
So just the afternoon , one Thursday .
Just silence , that &apos;s it .
It &apos;s better than a computer .
Because work , like sleep , happens in phases .
Just don &apos;t have it .
So thanks for listening .
Dianna Cohen : Tough truths about plastic pollution
And I thought , &quot; Great .
It &apos;s ephemeral just like us . &quot;
So in looking at that , I also realized that I was really angry .
It &apos;s plastic pollution .
What is the reality of that ?
Thank you .
Let &apos;s talk about manias .
Manias can be good .
Manias can be alarming .
Or manias can be deadly .
The world has a new mania .
A mania for learning English .
Teacher : ... change my life !
Students : I will change my life .
T : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
T : I don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
S : I don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
T : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
Two billion of them .
Students : A t-shirt . A dress .
Why English ? In a single word : Opportunity .
Teacher : Perfect ! Students : Perfect !
T : Perfect ! S : Perfect !
T : I want to speak perfect English .
S : I want to speak perfect English .
T : I want to change my life !
S : I want to change my life !
English is the world &apos;s second language .
Your native language is your life .
The world has other universal languages .
Mathematics is the language of science .
Music is the language of emotions .
So English mania is a turning point .
Thank you very much .
Hello , Doha . Hello . Salaam alaikum .
This is like -- it feels like the United Nations just here .
I said , &quot; Where are the Qataris ? &quot;
&quot; They know . &quot;
And then we sat there for two minutes .
I &apos;m working already . &quot;
I go , &quot; I don &apos;t know where we &apos;re going . &quot;
&quot; Neither do I. It will be an adventure , sir . &quot;
Any Lebanese by applause ? Lebanese .
Yeah . The Middle East is going crazy .
Who would have thought ? Oh my gosh .
No . There &apos;s serious issues in the region .
I was in Lebanon , I got used to three .
I &apos;m going to be all right . &quot;
Qataris , you guys do the nose to nose .
I need to rest . &quot;
There &apos;s so much , we laugh , right ?
Maybe like an evil -- like , &quot; Wuhahaha , wuhahaha .
I will kill you in the name of Allah , wuhahahahaha . &quot;
But never like , &quot; ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha . &quot;
We like to laugh . We like to celebrate life .
Never &quot; Hi , Jack . &quot;
&quot; &#91; Imitating Arabic &#93; -- rainbow ! &quot;
&quot; &#91; Imitating Arabic &#93; -- Tutti Frutti ! &quot;
&quot; I think he &apos;s going to hijack the plane with some ice cream . &quot;
Thank you very much . Have a good night .
Thank you , TED .
Handspring Puppet Co . : The genius puppetry behind War Horse
AK : The ancestor of the horse .
Okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
Hahahaha .
So it needed a very articulate front paw .
AK : Haa haa haaa .
BJ : Breath is really important for us .
It &apos;s the thing that distinguishes the puppet -- AK : Oops .
BJ : From an actor .
BJ : Okay so .
BJ : His mother was a puppeteer .
I really thought they were so beneath me .
BJ : And here again , you see the same structure .
And he &apos;s controlling the ear movement .
AK : It seemed a lovely idea .
But they agreed to go along with it for a while .
So we began with a test .
So we made a model .
BJ : And the two manipulators are inside .
And we had a crate built for it .
It had to be shipped to London .
BJ : About 40 people .
AK : We were terrified .
It had by no means got the green light yet .
And so the show was given the green light .
Here is the plan .
The horses are completely handmade .
There is very little 20th century technology in them .
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey .
Joey boy , you there ?
Joey .
Joey .
Joey , come here .
No , no , I haven &apos;t got it .
He &apos;s got it ; it &apos;s in his pocket .
BJ : Joey .
AK : Joey , Joey , Joey , Joey .
Move around . Come on .
Here , Craig is working the head .
Horses &apos; hearing is very important .
It &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
He &apos;s working the leg .
Horses are so unpredictable .
The hind legs have got the same action .
BJ : We had a big challenge with breathing .
AK : Other emotional stuff .
You see the skeletal structure of it .
Again , that was a practical consideration .
The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out .
And it &apos;s very much an in-the-moment activity that they &apos;re engaged in .
It &apos;s three heads making one character .
And plant .
Thank you .
AK : Mikey Brett from Leicestershire .
Thank you . Thank you .
And I thought , you know , what &apos;s wrong with me ?
You &apos;ve got to date around .
I am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts .
So that wasn &apos;t going to work .
So again , I started doing some math .
Population of Philadelphia : It has 1.5 million people .
I figure about half of that are men , so that takes the number down to 750,000 .
That &apos;s only 2.3 percent of the population .
Are the families going to get along ?
What &apos;s the rabbi going to say ?
Are they going to start having children right away ?
So I decided to sign on .
Now , there was one small catch .
I talked a lot about JavaScript .
There was this guy Steve , the I.T. guy .
In fact , he didn &apos;t even bother looking at the menu .
And listen , I &apos;m a modern woman .
I am totally down with splitting the bill .
But then Steve the I.T. guy didn &apos;t come back .
And they say to me , &quot; Stop complaining . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re just being too picky . &quot;
There were just bad for me .
Do you like horror films or romance films ?
I &apos;m not looking for a pen pal .
I &apos;m looking for a husband . Right ?
So there &apos;s a certain amount of superficiality in that data .
So I said fine , I &apos;ve got a new plan .
Well , as it turns out , this worked pretty well .
So I go back online now .
And I thought , I &apos;ve done it !
I &apos;ve cracked the code .
There was only one problem : He didn &apos;t like me back .
I found SmileyGirl1978 .
She listed her job as teacher .
So I created 10 fake male profiles .
I didn &apos;t carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody .
I really was just scraping their data .
So I didn &apos;t reach out to any woman first .
And as it turns out , content matters a lot .
Also , optimistic language matters a lot .
And as it turns out , timing is also really , really important .
And finally , there were the photos .
All of the women who were popular showed some skin .
And as it turns out , I did a really good job .
I was the most popular person online .
How soon are you going out ? &quot;
He talked in detail about travel .
He made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
It was enough for a date .
Well , as it turns out , there is an algorithm for love .
It &apos;s just not the ones that we &apos;re being presented with online .
It looks like you did come up with a really , really great system .
Now , your matzoh balls .
They should be fluffy , not hard . &quot;
And I &apos;ll take her advice on that .
Richard Seymour : How beauty feels
But I felt something .
And it was a physiological response .
Now you probably know the answer to this already .
Remember that ?
I remember it clearly .
I thought , well what the hell &apos;s that about ?
So I started to ask myself questions about it .
I thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
And so I did some experiments .
And this isn &apos;t a think , it &apos;s a feel .
And would you do me a favor ?
For the next 14 minutes or whatever it is , will you feel stuff ?
I get a sense of anticipation &quot; ?
Now I &apos;m not a neuroscientist .
But it might be .
So this leads me to think of this in a different way .
They arrive first .
So how do we make that actually work ?
It &apos;s a plastic bag .
Look at that . What are you feeling about it ?
Is it beautiful ? Is it exciting ?
I &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
Maybe there &apos;s an innocence to it .
It &apos;s the last thing she did , the last physical act .
Look at that picture .
Is it beautiful now ?
Stop . Stop . How do you feel ?
Where are you feeling this ?
I &apos;m feeling it here . I feel it here .
The lady over there is actually crying , by the way .
But what are you doing ?
I watch what people do .
I watch faces .
I watch reactions .
It &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;
That &apos;s not the expression of joy .
There &apos;s something weird happening .
It isn &apos;t just about nice .
And this is the dilemma , this is the paradox , of beauty .
And that &apos;s packed in there as well .
Well it obviously isn &apos;t .
And they found that it was almost exact coincidence .
So it wasn &apos;t about symmetry .
But they &apos;re both different .
I &apos;m not getting it off the eyebrow .
And this is the F1 MV Agusta .
Ahhhh .
It &apos;s masses and masses of layers .
It &apos;s something much bigger .
So that &apos;s getting me excited .
And I feel that here .
Titanium lacquer on this .
I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
I &apos;m really getting into this now .
So it disappears .
Why would you do that ?
So it &apos;s more expensive , but it &apos;s wonderful .
Massimo Tamburini .
We have to deal with it .
And so look at her .
I &apos;ve had to make a bit of a compromise there .
No one &apos;s noticed , have they yet ?
Did you see what I did ?
I moved three things by a millimeter .
Pretty ? Yes .
Beautiful ? Maybe lesser .
So that &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
No one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
And only a few people can do it .
And a focus group cannot do it .
And a team rarely can do it .
So all hail to that .
It &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
And they &apos;re working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it .
You also may be taking into account the fact that it &apos;s incredibly painful .
So we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
Are you ready ? Okay .
It &apos;s not .
So is that wrong ?
But you &apos;re a slave of that first flash .
It wins or loses at that point .
And finally , the layer that I love , of knowledge .
Yeah ?
It &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
No time . It says I have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
You didn &apos;t maybe know it .
But how do you feel about it ?
Form follows function ?
Only sometimes . Only sometimes .
Form is function . Form is function .
Thank you very much .
Tom Thum : The orchestra in my mouth
We &apos;re going to take it back , way back , back into time .
Wassup .
Thank you very much , TEDx .
Look at this , Mom ! I made it !
You know , I &apos;m from Brisbane , which is a great city to live in .
We start our journey in the central deserts .
India .
China .
Germany .
Party , party , yeah .
TEDx .
I got way too much time on my hands .
All right boys , take it away .
Mr. Smokey Jefferson , let &apos;s take it for a walk . Come on , baby .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Lesley Hazleton : On reading the Koran
But the thing is , how come it &apos;s news to most people ?
Now I did have an advantage .
So I read slowly .
But all is not lost in translation .
Only God knows the true meaning .
Old-fashioned Orientalism comes into play here .
And that number 72 never appears .
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran .
Paradise is quite the opposite .
It &apos;s plenty .
Thank you .
Eddi Reader : &quot; What You &apos;ve Got &quot;
Karen Tse : How to stop torture
He was not a political prisoner .
And the third is commitment .
Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
A judge would let her out . &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot;
Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
Because it sounds big .
Never going to happen . &quot;
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Kim Gorgens : Protecting the brain against concussion
Awwww .
I &apos;ll just say , July .
Zzzzzzip for safety .
Water wings -- an inch of water .
He &apos;s interested in playing football .
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle .
So why would I worry ?
It &apos;s what I study . It &apos;s what I treat .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right . &quot; Starsky and Hutch , &quot; arguably , yes .
So a car accident .
In case you missed it , we &apos;ll look again .
So look to the right-hand side of the screen .
What would you say ?
How many Gs ?
Close .
Seventy-two .
The average concussive impact is 95 Gs .
Because I know our brains are resilient .
They &apos;re designed to recover from an injury .
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury .
So you &apos;ve all seen that -- New York Times , you &apos;ve seen it .
If only .
She &apos;s totally not kidding . &quot;
But I do know there are three things you can do .
The first : study up .
There are some great resources out there .
The CDC has a program , Heads Up .
It &apos;s at CDC.gov.
The second thing is : speak up .
Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available .
What &apos;s the budget for protective equipment ?
How old it is ?
Wear a helmet .
So , should Vander play football ?
Thank you .
They were not the only ones .
So there was a bit of a conflict there .
He was told that a cure did not exist .
AIDS had become a chronic disease .
In 2002 , they were facing a different battle .
Today , eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs .
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV .
And there &apos;s something else .
They also stop passing on the virus .
This is fairly recent science that has shown that .
So what &apos;s the problem ?
Well , things have changed .
First of all , the rules have changed .
So what India did is no longer possible .
This is the landscape of one medicine .
Again , deliberate action is needed .
And we did .
That can be generic manufacturers .
The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism .
They were forced to do so .
Today , Nelson Otwoma is healthy .
He has access to antiretroviral drugs .
His son will soon be 14 years old .
And this is no longer fantasy .
This has never been done before .
This has never been seen before .
Thank you .
David Deutsch : Chemical scum that dream of distant quasars
And so what does that look like ? Typical .
What does a typical place in the universe look like ?
That &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
And that is how un-typical this place is .
So can we have the lights back on please ? Thank you .
So , the laws of physics have this special property .
Now , our environment is inundated with evidence .
So we &apos;re not in a uniquely hospitable place .
And the controversy is global warming .
At the moment , these things are fringe research .
So take two stone tablets , and carve on them .
On one of them , carve : &quot; Problems are soluble . &quot;
And on the other one carve : &quot; Problems are inevitable . &quot;
Thank you .
Well , you probably recognize the first person .
It all begins with enjoyment .
We are late to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
We are going to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot; We are late .
We are running late .
We must go to watch &quot; Afghan Star . &quot;
And you don &apos;t necessarily have to have your own TV set .
Contestants also put themselves forward .
And she &apos;s out there .
But actually , just the opposite is happening .
No small thing .
Thank you .
Bastian Schaefer : A 3D-printed jumbo jet ?
What do we know about the future ?
We cannot predict the future .
What are the main customers of the future ?
These are the future anthropometrics .
These people have different needs .
We want to be treated as individuals .
This will be very different in the future .
So let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world .
It follows the design of bone .
The design process is completely different .
Push this idea a little bit forward .
And nature builds large skeletons out of it .
And the same approach can be applied to technology as well .
And you &apos;ve got trillions of them .
So how might the airplane of the future look ?
See you in the future . Thank you .
How did Movember start ?
Why hasn &apos;t that made a comeback ?
Parents would shuffle kids away from us .
We can &apos;t have anything to do with you . &quot;
Essentially , I &apos;m a mustache farmer .
And my season is November .
Bring this campaign to these countries .
So we thought , why not ? Let &apos;s do it .
It wasn &apos;t as successful as we thought it would be .
And for us , we have redefined charity .
And I said , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s interesting . &quot;
Your mom would be so proud . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Thank you for doing Movember . &quot;
So now , that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer .
And that &apos;s how we &apos;re redefining the research world .
Thank you .
For example : Why is Apple so innovative ?
And yet , they &apos;re just a computer company .
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
Then why is it that they seem to have something different ?
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement ?
Why him ?
There &apos;s something else at play here .
About three and a half years ago I made a discovery .
As it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern .
And it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
I call it the golden circle .
Why ? How ? What ?
Let me define the terms really quickly .
That &apos;s a result . It &apos;s always a result .
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belief ?
Why does your organization exist ?
And why should anyone care ?
Let me give you an example .
Want to buy one ? &quot; &quot; Meh . &quot;
And that &apos;s how most of us communicate .
But it &apos;s uninspiring .
Here &apos;s how Apple actually communicates .
We believe in thinking differently .
We just happen to make great computers .
Want to buy one ? &quot;
In fact , they tried .
A few years ago , Gateway came out with flat screen TVs .
They &apos;re eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs .
They &apos;ve been making flat screen monitors for years .
Nobody bought one .
But we do it every day .
It &apos;s all grounded in the tenets of biology .
Not psychology , biology .
It just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
This is where gut decisions come from .
Why would we use that verb , it doesn &apos;t &quot; feel &quot; right ?
Most people don &apos;t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley .
Everybody was trying it .
Money was no problem .
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different .
He was in pursuit of the result .
He was in pursuit of the riches .
And lo and behold , look what happened .
The others just worked for the paycheck .
We found out about it a few days later .
Well , you can trip over 10 percent of the customers .
That &apos;s how we describe them , right ?
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
First , the famous failure .
It &apos;s a commercial example .
Look at TiVo .
They were extremely well-funded .
Market conditions were fantastic .
I mean , we use TiVo as verb .
But TiVo &apos;s a commercial failure .
They &apos;ve never made money .
And the cynical majority said , &quot; We don &apos;t believe you .
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
You &apos;re scaring us . &quot;
How do you do that ?
In fact , some of his ideas were bad .
But he had a gift .
How many of them showed up for him ?
Zero .
They showed up for themselves .
They &apos;re not inspiring anybody .
Thank you very much .
Yet , there is hope .
So , doctors prescribe medication .
Why ?
No one can survive alone .
And very often violence is a way to cope with it .
And partly this is already happening .
So the key here is empathy .
Somebody has to feel how you felt .
And somebody has to see you and listen to you .
And I started thinking about a counseling program .
But , of course , I needed help and funds .
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that .
And 70 percent regained their lives .
And I would like to share one short vignette .
I thank you for your attention .
Brenda Romero : Gaming for understanding
All these things happen to me .
This is one my partner and I worked on .
So this one here , this is the 1980 Olympics .
And so this was just an amazing experience .
And this is one of my favorite shots here .
Just imagine if that &apos;s a black guy .
Right ? Like , seriously , nobody would do this .
But every other medium does it .
So she said , &quot; We talked about the Middle Passage . &quot;
Pause for about 10 seconds .
&quot; Can I play a game , Mommy ? &quot;
And so I happened to have all of these little pieces .
So she &apos;s painting her little families .
Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage . &quot;
&quot; But I &apos;d get to see them in America . &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; So Daddy could be gone . &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience .
My history is Irish .
I made another game called Train .
This is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
It &apos;s the same thing .
And originally it was a math problem more or less .
Like , here &apos;s the economics of illegal immigration .
I &apos;ll look away from the picture .
Ann Cooper : What &apos;s wrong with school lunches
Everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
That &apos;s my premise .
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness .
And then we talk about organic food .
We can &apos;t keep doing that .
You know , it doesn &apos;t work .
And the results of that are kids getting sick .
Seventy percent -- it &apos;s unbelievable .
And the result of it is , we have diseases .
And that has to change , you know .
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food .
It really is just a new idea .
It &apos;s no wonder , you know , we have criminals .
And what &apos;s happening is , we &apos;re getting sick .
We &apos;re getting sick and our kids are getting sick .
It is about what we feed them .
What goes in is what we are .
We really are what we eat .
What &apos;s going to happen ?
And it &apos;s because of what we feed them .
This is the USDA portion size , that little , tiny thing .
And why can they serve that much ?
This is not even food .
Everything came in plastic , in cardboard .
The USDA allows this .
The USDA allows all of this stuff .
It ain &apos;t okay . You know what ? It is not okay .
Well , Tyson did , because there &apos;s no chicken in the chicken .
But this is what most schools serve .
There &apos;s not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .
Now , in Berkeley , we &apos;ve gone totally fresh .
We &apos;re cooking from scratch every day .
They &apos;re not going to be smart .
You know what ? They &apos;re just going to be sick .
And these calendars really started to lay out my program .
So this is a typical menu .
And you see these recipes on the side ?
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .
The really tiny hamburger , the really big vegetables .
We have to start changing this .
What are kids learning ? Where is the family time ?
Where is socialization ? Where is discussion ?
Where is learning to talk ?
You know , we have to change it .
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating .
We have recycling in all of our schools .
Schools are underfunded .
That comes down to under five dollars an hour .
We really need to change it .
It &apos;s going to take more money .
It &apos;s sort of this &quot; duh &quot; thing .
We need to -- we need to educate .
We need to educate the kids .
We need to educate the staff .
I had 90 employees .
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could .
But we really have to educate .
That is not lunchtime .
That number probably needs to double .
200 billion .
You know what ? We should be ashamed .
We , as a country , should be ashamed at that .
The richest country .
And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of .
We can all make a difference .
Sit down and care .
Thank you .
Fabian Oefner : Psychedelic science
The first one has to do with making sound visible .
So I came up with the following setup .
Thank you very much .
I agree , it looks pretty amazing .
I got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in Los Angeles .
Should I skip that part ?
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior .
It &apos;s a liquid that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an oily consistency .
That &apos;s because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic .
So that was the second project .
And at the same time , alcohol is highly flammable .
Let me demonstrate this over here .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
Add some more .
And now , let &apos;s set that on fire .
So that &apos;s all that happens .
Thank you .
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
Is it just a waste of whiskey ?
Is it just some strange materials ?
Thank you very much .
And our minds have altered , too .
Now this has raised all sorts of questions .
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted ?
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness .
A crow can peck at a fish .
And he said , &quot; Of course not .
One &apos;s a fish .
The other is a bird . &quot;
Hamburg is a city in Germany .
Are there camels in Hamburg ? &quot;
And Luria said , &quot; At the North Pole , there is always snow .
None of these problems are real .
How can we address them ? &quot;
And so forth .
So the tenor of education has changed .
What about employment ?
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands .
The professions have been upgraded .
Or take a farmer today .
But I &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
I &apos;m primarily a moral philosopher .
How would you feel about that ?
They &apos;re just inherited mores .
Would you deserve to be killed ?
Well you , today , universalize your principles .
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them .
What are dogs like ?
They would say wolves .
They could say a semicircle .
They live in the bubble of the present .
As if they were a reptile .
Dan Gilbert : Why we make bad decisions
Now , let me talk about the first one first .
And of course , you all know that the answer is dogs .
That &apos;s not a bad rule of thumb , except when it is .
So , for example , here &apos;s a word puzzle .
Compare these to the actual numbers .
Drownings and asthma deaths don &apos;t get much coverage .
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?
We see this on TV ; we read about it in the paper .
There &apos;s 10 tickets in this lottery .
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals .
Well , Bernoulli tells us it is .
And most people say , &quot; OK , I &apos;ll play . &quot;
Leroy has nine tickets ; there &apos;s one left .
It &apos;s easy to see Leroy getting the check , right ?
I want to talk now about errors in value .
How much is this Big Mac worth ? Is it worth 25 dollars ?
Imagine that you &apos;re going to the theater .
You &apos;re on your way to the theater .
You also have a 20-dollar bill .
Most people answer , no .
Now , let &apos;s just change one thing in this scenario .
Well , of course , I went to the theater to see the play .
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do ?
Along the way , you lost something .
In both cases , it was a piece of paper .
What the hell difference should it make ?
Suddenly , we &apos;re almost longing for him to return .
The comparison changes how we evaluate him .
So , they will opt for the item in the middle .
Let me just give you an example .
They &apos;re sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them .
Most people say they would .
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy , and it should .
It doesn &apos;t know what you saved it on .
You &apos;ve all had this experience .
This is what we call a one-item IQ test , OK ?
Well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
What do we find now ?
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ?
Now , why in the world do you get this pattern of results ?
These guys can tell us .
However , the difference between them seems to be getting smaller .
Here are the results of what I just showed you .
And I want you to see that two things are true .
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us .
I &apos;ll take the 50 dollars now .
Thank you .
That was remarkable .
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert . One and two .
Talk more about it .
It &apos;s out-sized . I mean , look .
Is terror the right response ?
What is it ?
That &apos;s not my point at all .
I think in the case of terrorism , it isn &apos;t .
There are no guns going off .
That &apos;s a tough one .
There &apos;s no question .
People died ; so be it .
And so we evolved these responses .
Is that what happened ?
That &apos;s what you think it is . All right ?
It &apos;s not because she is stupid or he is stupid .
Last question .
For you or for them ?
AdG : In persuading them .
Ah , for you in persuading them .
But these are tricks around the margins .
Richard Wilkinson : How economic inequality harms societies
I want to start though with a paradox .
This , again , is life expectancy .
I &apos;m not using any hypothetical data .
We put them all in one index .
They &apos;re all weighted equally .
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily close correlation .
Everything goes into it .
Highly significant relationship .
Here , for instance , is trust .
It comes from the World Values Survey .
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
Same thing is going on .
We &apos;re not just talking about a fluke .
This is mental illness .
And again , closely related to inequality .
This is violence .
But look at the scale of the differences .
This is the proportion of the population in prison .
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
Here we have children dropping out of high school .
Again , quite big differences .
This is social mobility .
There &apos;s more social mobility .
I could have shown a number of other problems .
Japan is rather different though .
It has lower taxes .
It has a smaller welfare state .
This is just one example .
It &apos;s infant mortality .
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society .
It also leads to status insecurity .
Now we have been criticized .
Otherwise that would introduce bias .
What about other countries ?
Why don &apos;t we control for other factors ?
What about causality ?
We spend a good bit of time .
Thank you .
Animals are not just raw materials .
Now how do we do it ?
This collagen is the stuff between cells .
It &apos;s natural connective tissue .
What could the future of animal products look like ?
Rather , it could be much more like this .
It is where cell culture takes place .
It &apos;s environmentally responsible , efficient and humane .
It allows us to be creative .
Thank you .
Nick Sears : Demo : The Orb
We can use LEDs .
Most importantly for this , they &apos;re faster .
And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision .
The equator &apos;s speed is actually about 60 miles per hour .
But this is really just the beginning .
It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes .
These blocks represent LEDs .
So , take a look .
But this piece is due out in May .
There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects .
Adam Ostrow : After your final status update
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
Consider a few stats for a moment .
Adam Ostrow : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
AO : Who is this ?
Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
Thank you very much .
Jehane Noujaim : My wish : A global day of film
And I know what you &apos;re thinking .
She &apos;s not . She &apos;s at the TED Prize .
That &apos;s great . That &apos;s great .
This is Donna .
This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty .
This is Donna eating ice cream .
So we &apos;re not forcing people to travel .
So I &apos;m the living product of two cultures coming together .
No pun intended .
And I began to start teaching there .
So I was 18 ; I was very excited .
And as I sat there , I got very depressed .
And I just saw the power of the image .
And it was incredible .
And so that &apos;s what really kind of started me off .
So I knew that I had to go there .
I just wanted to be in the center .
I had no plan . I had no funding .
I &apos;ve got to go see what this is all about .
Sameer Khader : Business as usual .
To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream .
I still have that dream .
Maybe I will never be able to do it .
I will pay for their study .
And they will stay there .
And it was revolting .
It was absolutely revolting .
It made me sick to my stomach .
And they were equally if not more horrifying -- the images were .
That &apos;s bad . &quot;
And it didn &apos;t affect me as much .
It makes me hate war .
We had no funding for it .
He kind of redefined us as an American population .
Al Jazeera offered him a job .
And I saw this with audiences .
How do we understand what the other person is thinking ? &quot;
We still have Paradise .
God forbid !
May God forgive you .
In this life , we &apos;re dead anyway .
And what about us ? The ones who remain ?
Will we win that way ?
How , if Israel has no morals ?
Be careful !
Ayelet : What do you know about the casualties ?
We &apos;re looking for three girls .
Tzvika : We have no information .
Are you sure she is dead ? &quot;
They said yes .
I am the headmaster for all parts .
George : But there is a teacher that is in charge ?
Tzvika : Yes , I have assistants .
I deal with children all the time .
George : At first , I thought it was a strange idea .
George : There were many things that touched me .
I know where you guys are coming from .
Death unto apartheid ! &quot;
Yes . Yes !
Freedom !
And that &apos;s what this is about .
And that &apos;s an amazing thing .
There &apos;s Witness , that you heard from earlier .
And we started calling up everybody .
And we called that landmass Pangea .
And that &apos;s my wish .
That is an incredible wish .
Pangea Cinema -- the day the world comes together .
Daniel Libeskind : 17 words of architectural inspiration
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
And yet , at the end , it &apos;s so hard to change a wall .
We applaud the well-mannered box .
And I think that &apos;s really what architecture is based on .
It &apos;s based on wonder .
These are the dimensions that I like to work with .
It &apos;s something very personal .
So again , I am a believer in the expressive .
I have never been a fan of the neutral .
I think expression .
That &apos;s what expression is .
Expressive spaces may disturb us .
And I think that &apos;s also part of life .
And I think that is what architecture is , it &apos;s radical .
So again I am a believer in the radical architecture .
It &apos;s like the old Las Vegas used to be .
Therefore I believe it should not be cool .
There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture .
Life without emotion would really not be life .
Even the mind is emotional .
And of course , we are all about the struggle of emotions .
I think that is the progress of cities .
But architecture is not the language of words .
Hand versus the computer .
Of course , what would we be without computers ?
Our whole practice depends on computing .
It is complex . Space is complex .
And yet , our lives are complex .
Our emotions are complex .
Our intellectual desires are complex .
Of course that means that architecture is political .
The political is not an enemy of architecture .
The politeama is the city . It &apos;s all of us together .
Because architecture is also the asking of questions .
It &apos;s not only the giving of answers .
It &apos;s also , just like life , the asking of questions .
Therefore it is important that it be real .
You know we can simulate almost anything .
It &apos;s not something that comes to us from books and theories .
Unexpected versus habitual .
What is a habit ? It &apos;s just a shackle for ourselves .
It &apos;s a self-induced poison .
So the unexpected is always unexpected .
And of course habits are enforced by architecture .
And of course buildings have their shapes .
Those shapes are difficult to change .
So that is indeed what is memory .
Without memory we would be amnesiacs .
So again , memory is the city , memory is the world .
There would be nowhere to turn .
It &apos;s an art of communication .
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available .
Cities should be full of vibrations , full of sound , full of music .
And these are our dreams .
And of course risk . I think architecture should be risky .
And I think , of course , risk is what underlies the world .
World without risk would not be worth living .
It &apos;s about space . It &apos;s not about fashion .
It &apos;s not about decoration .
It &apos;s about carving out a space for trees .
And I think that is really the nature of architecture .
Now I am a believer in democracy .
And of course , at Ground Zero what else ?
It &apos;s such a complex project .
It &apos;s emotional . There is so many interests .
There is so many interests . There &apos;s money . There &apos;s political power .
There are emotions of the victims .
I think architecture is about consensus .
It &apos;s difficult . 2011 , 2013 . Freedom Tower , the memorial .
And that is where I end .
This is America . This is liberty .
I &apos;ve got a question .
Not just for New York , but for the world .
Thank you so much , Daniel Libeskind .
Ben Cameron : The true power of the performing arts
I have read the &quot; Twilight &quot; tetralogy .
But as particular as they feel to us , we know we &apos;re not alone .
Whatever we do together is pure invention .
The maps they gave us are out of date by years . &quot;
Thank you , and godspeed .
Niels Diffrient : Rethinking the way we sit down
Now I &apos;m talking about the &apos; 30s .
And then mount his airplane , maybe for the last time .
But this was real romance to me .
The product was that airplane .
But it built a romance .
Even the parts of the airplane had French names .
Ze fuselage , ze empanage , ze nessal .
You know , from a romance language .
It did mine .
I wanted to build airplanes .
So I built model airplanes .
You had to learn about aeronautics .
I &apos;d wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class .
You should be in the art department . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
So my romance was temporarily shifted .
Studied painting ; didn &apos;t do very well at that .
Went through design , some architecture .
And it exists .
And I quit .
I wanted to get back where the romance was .
So I chose furniture .
But not office chairs .
So I started doing that .
I conceived the kind of airplane .
I basically engineered it .
I built it .
And I flew it .
And that &apos;s the way I work now .
There are drawbacks to this .
They will sit in them forever .
She said , &quot; Oh I love it . &quot;
She said , &quot; But it &apos;s too high . &quot;
He came over and looked at it .
She said , &quot; Oh it &apos;s wonderful . How did you do that ? &quot;
And he showed her the lever .
So I spent a long time .
And they go up easily .
And stop where you want .
You can put them down , essentially out of the way .
No arms at all .
Just your own .
There &apos;s two of them , one on either side .
And that &apos;s a lot of load .
And breathability is good .
So that &apos;s where a headrest comes in .
So here we are .
You cant hit your elbow on bottom .
I love video games .
I &apos;m also slightly in awe of them .
That &apos;s about three times the recorded music industry .
On the one hand , there &apos;s the wanting processes .
It &apos;s a really great image . It &apos;s pretty cool .
Because it &apos;s very powerful . It &apos;s pretty awesome .
It gives you great powers .
It &apos;s a very great pleasure to fly around .
But this isn &apos;t the really interesting stuff .
It &apos;s something called the reward schedule .
Simple game quest .
I &apos;ve got to keep opening boxes .
Let &apos;s think about probability .
It keeps people engaged .
That would be very boring .
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number .
There &apos;s 100 percent up here .
But we don &apos;t just do that either .
So all this is very powerful .
So we can do some rather amazing things .
They &apos;re not rational about probability .
They think this game is unfair .
Third , you reward effort .
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement .
Fourth , feedback .
It &apos;s very hard to learn , to feel a lesson .
And fifth , the element of uncertainty .
The 25 percent . This lights the brain up .
We just want to go back and find out more .
It &apos;s associated with reward-seeking behavior .
And two things really flow from this .
This can all seem very sinister .
The word &quot; addiction &quot; is thrown around .
There are real concerns there .
This is what really excites us .
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent .
Let &apos;s start with business .
We can use calculated randomness .
Thank you very much .
Matthew Childs : 9 life lessons from rock climbing
Most of them are pretty basic .
Number one : don &apos;t let go -- very sure success method .
Number two : hesitation is bad .
Rule number three : have a plan .
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him .
And then what happens ?
And you &apos;re completely flamed out . Don &apos;t do it .
So you &apos;ve got to focus .
You &apos;ve got to keep going .
Rule number five : know how to rest .
This is a climb in the Needles , again in California .
And of course there is rule number nine .
So don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
Thank you very much .
Jim Fallon : Exploring the mind of a killer
So that &apos;s what I normally do .
So I &apos;ve looked at about 70 of these .
And what came up was a number of pieces of data .
So we &apos;re interested in exactly where in the brain , and what &apos;s the most important part of the brain .
It &apos;s really a very precisely timed thing .
You get different kinds of psychopaths .
They had other sorts of brain damage .
And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population .
And it does have some consequences .
Right ? That &apos;s how the mirror neuron system works .
And now the boys and the girls get them .
So that was the idea .
And you &apos;re talking as if you come from a normal family . &quot;
I said , &quot; What the hell are you talking about ? &quot;
She then told me about our own family tree .
Now she blamed this on my father &apos;s side , of course .
Well she said , &quot; There is good news and bad news .
Now I said , &quot; Okay , so what ? We have Lizzie . &quot;
And here is this &quot; Killed Strangely , &quot; and it &apos;s this historical book .
Okay , so that &apos;s the first case of matricide .
But it doesn &apos;t stop there .
Okay , now this gives one a little pause .
But more likely is this .
And they all seemed to be OK .
But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here .
They have the same brain , and the same EEG .
And now they are close as can be .
But there &apos;s gonna be bad news somewhere .
And we don &apos;t know where it &apos;s going to pop up .
So that &apos;s my talk .
Robert Gordon : The death of innovation , the end of growth
That &apos;s how we traveled in the year 1900 .
It doesn &apos;t have air conditioning .
That &apos;s a Boeing 707 .
They &apos;re demographics , education , debt and inequality .
They &apos;re powerful enough to cut growth in half .
Now here &apos;s eight centuries of economic growth .
Then growth gets better and better .
But you know what the actual facts are ?
Negative .
This led to a fantasy .
What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record ?
Well , it &apos;s a matter of arithmetic .
That means we &apos;d go from 44,000 to 180,000 .
The first headwind is demographics .
But now it &apos;s turned around .
The next headwind is education .
We have a lot of debt .
So that brings us down to 0.8 .
And that 0.8 is the big challenge .
Are we going to grow at 0.8 ?
So let &apos;s see what some of those inventions were .
By 1929 , electric light was everywhere .
Central Manhattan became possible .
Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women .
They did it on a scrub board .
Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry .
Then they had to bring them in .
And then we had the electric washing machine .
And by 1950 , they were everywhere .
The bedrooms were cold . They were unheated .
What about the internal combustion engine , which was invented in 1879 ?
And I &apos;ll just give you a few examples .
We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound .
What about the electronic revolution ?
Here &apos;s an early computer .
But I &apos;m now going to give you an experiment .
You have to choose either option A or option B.
So here we are back to the horse and buggy .
Thank you .
Derek Sivers : How to start a movement
Now , there he is calling to his friends .
And here comes a second follower .
So a movement must be public .
Now we &apos;ve got a movement .
And that &apos;s how you make a movement .
But let &apos;s recap some lessons from this .
Okay , but we might have missed the real lesson here .
And what a perfect place to do that , at TED .
Thanks .
Mark Pagel : How language transformed humanity
Now this may sound arrogant , or even full of hubris .
How do we know this ?
You can follow it through the fossil record .
But by comparison , we can learn .
We can benefit from others &apos; ideas .
We can build on their wisdom .
And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation .
Social learning really is visual theft .
Well , we chose the second option , and language is the result .
We &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Now the job is done .
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows .
Language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved .
Language really is the voice of our genes .
Now you might say , well , this is just natural .
And he said to me , &quot; Oh no .
They &apos;re far closer together than that . &quot;
They slow the flow of technologies .
And they even slow the flow of genes .
This remarkable image is not a map of the world .
And they impose a barrier to cooperation .
Now think of the absurdity of this situation .
Thank you .
Matt Ridley : Mark , one question .
Mark Pagel : This is a very good question .
MR : Thank you very much indeed .
Chris Jordan : Turning powerful stats into art
They just don &apos;t do that in that industry .
That &apos;s 15 minutes of our cup consumption .
And there &apos;s an hour &apos;s worth of our cups .
And there &apos;s a day &apos;s worth of our cups .
And I wanted to show the number .
And this particular one is about cigarette addiction .
And do you remember the response ?
And today , 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking .
The tobacco lobby , it &apos;s too strong .
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
And this is what the next piece is about .
A strange phenomenon .
The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21 .
Now , I want to emphasize that these are just examples .
I &apos;m not holding these out as being the biggest issues .
They &apos;re just examples .
There &apos;s this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment .
They &apos;ve gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing .
We can &apos;t make meaning out of these enormous statistics .
I &apos;m not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way .
I &apos;m simply saying , this is who we are right now .
Thank you and good afternoon .
Seth Berkley : HIV and flu -- the vaccine strategy
Do you worry about what is going to kill you ?
Heart disease , cancer , a car accident ?
But what really threatens humanity ?
Every year , 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu .
Are we safer today ?
We can do this .
Why is that ?
Well , here &apos;s the dirty little secret .
So let &apos;s explore how vaccines work .
So that &apos;s really how vaccines work .
The virus is defeated .
Seth Berkley : Really cool video , isn &apos;t it ?
So let &apos;s take a look at the flu virus .
It was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
Now let &apos;s take a look at HIV .
Now , what does this mean ?
So what we &apos;ve got is a situation .
So think of it this way .
Let me give you another example .
These are largely hidden from the immune system .
So I want you to think back a few months ago .
Vaccines were promised to developing countries .
So what happened ?
So today , we get our flu vaccines from ...
chicken eggs , hundreds of millions of chicken eggs .
Almost nothing has changed .
So , here &apos;s an alarming thought .
And the process still takes more than half a year .
So are we better prepared than we were in 1918 ?
With a range of new technologies , we could .
Now think of where this leads us .
Luckily , this year &apos;s flu was relatively mild .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , the science is changing .
So , the challenge is full speed ahead .
And malaria &apos;s even further behind ?
The world needs people like you . Thank you .
SB : Thank you .
Graham Hawkes : A flight through the ocean
We still have one foot in the dark ages .
This is an ocean planet .
So I have one message .
And it &apos;s all a question of perspective .
Well , it &apos;s the relative importance .
It &apos;s a thin film , two-dimensional existence .
The ocean representation would have a depth to it .
That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority .
Because it &apos;s a problem we have .
This is an acryclic sphere .
And this one actually carries two great manipulators .
Now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere .
Fish do not sit in seats .
They don &apos;t fall over . They don &apos;t fall .
It &apos;s truly a three-dimensional space .
And we &apos;re only just beginning to grasp it .
This is the way we should be going into the oceans .
This is a three-dimensional machine .
OK , this is good stuff .
This is man &apos;s first attempt at flying underwater .
She has twice the wingspan that I do .
There I &apos;m coming ; she sees me .
I &apos;m trying to do everything very gently .
And this ballet is controlled by this lady here .
This is the first flying machine . This was the first prototype .
She just rolled right away from underneath .
It took 10 years to build .
I just had to go and build another machine .
Now , there she goes , right overhead .
This is a wide-angle camera .
She &apos;s just a few inches off the top of my head .
I come back up , not for air .
It was the fact she was going so slow .
She wanted to dance .
You see the larger wing area here .
So we opened the world &apos;s first flight school .
So we &apos;ve run two flight schools .
We &apos;ve decided we &apos;re just going to let that go .
The other thing is that we &apos;ve got much lower costs .
Thank you .
Sunitha Krishnan : The fight against sex slavery
Shaheen &apos;s background I don &apos;t even know .
They are sold in the name of adoption .
They are sold in the name of organ trade .
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation .
Where does their journey begin ?
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked .
These people are deceived , forced .
Some pay the price for it .
They &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
And we are silent about them .
We think it is easy money .
We think it is shortcut .
We think the person likes to do what she &apos;s doing .
And it &apos;s abnormal to live in a shelter .
It &apos;s abnormal to get rehabilitated .
It &apos;s in that context that I work .
She earns around 12,000 rupees .
She is an illiterate girl , trained , skilled as a welder .
Why welding and why not computers ?
What has been my challenge ?
I can &apos;t hear from my right ear .
My biggest challenge is society .
It &apos;s you and me .
And there is a long pause .
There it ends .
That &apos;s my biggest challenge .
They need your compassion .
They need your empathy .
Can you just encompass these people too ?
Because they are also a part of us .
They are also part of this world .
They died of AIDS last year .
Thank you .
Look at the skyline of Shanghai .
This is the Pudong area .
You &apos;re being constrained by the public &apos;s opinion .
Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agrees with that view .
You cannot be constrained by the public &apos;s opinion .
Here &apos;s the key question .
This is a key issue .
Country 1 has a systematic advantage over Country 2 in infrastructures .
And Country 2 is possibly India . &quot;
That &apos;s not too good .
The picture there is Khrushchev .
Telephones , infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth .
And Country 2 is China .
Yes , today China has a huge infrastructure advantage over India .
Let me look at this question more directly .
Is democracy bad for economic growth ?
Both countries are in Asia .
And which one is a democracy ? &quot;
Those two countries are geographically similar .
They have a complicated , but shared common history .
One reason is the East Asian Model .
Korea succeeded , North Korea didn &apos;t .
Burma didn &apos;t succeed .
The Philippines didn &apos;t succeed .
So exactly why did China grow so much faster ?
China was during the Cultural Revolution .
So that &apos;s when China was mad .
The whole country went mad .
China held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis-a-vis India .
This is an extremely strange fact .
So India is reverting to the normal .
In China , it &apos;s all women .
Then the issue is , what about the Chinese political system ?
What about the political system ?
Actually , the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .
There are also financial reforms in rural China .
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 .
The Indian government owned and operated all the TV stations .
One reason is they are always comparing India with China .
But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth .
Comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark .
This is a very impressive record indeed .
Which country has the growth momentum ?
But I believe that India has the momentum .
It has the improving fundamentals .
Thank you very much .
And this is what I &apos;ll tell you about .
So let &apos;s first talk about focused ultrasound .
It is made out of silicon .
It is transparent , made just for you .
So you see , it &apos;s all intact , completely transparent .
I &apos;ll take you now to the acoustic lab .
You see the phantom within the aquarium .
This is a setup I put in a physics lab .
Okay , so everything around it is whole and intact .
It &apos;s just a lesion formed inside .
So think about , this is in your brain .
We need to reach a target inside the brain .
And there was something fundamental that they were missing .
They were missing the vision .
And I will give you several examples .
So the first one is in the brain .
So I &apos;d like you to meet John .
And medication didn &apos;t help him anymore .
And this is his handwriting .
So we put the patient on the MR table .
And the physician will then take a regular MR scan .
And the objective of that ?
This is the sort of general area of the treatment .
It &apos;s a safety boundary around the target .
It &apos;s a target in the thalamus .
You see the transducer , the light blue .
There &apos;s water in between the skull and the transducer .
And it does this burst of energy .
It elevates the temperature .
And you can see the points there on the graph .
The temperature was raised to 43 degrees C temporarily .
This doesn &apos;t cause any damage .
But the point is we are right on target .
This is an immediate relief .
Thank you .
He said , &quot; Miraculous . &quot;
And you wonder why .
They are dependent on others .
And John today is fully independent .
He returned to a normal life routine .
It &apos;s like three millimeters in the middle of the brain .
There &apos;s no damage outside .
He suffers from no neurodeficit .
There &apos;s no recovery needed , no nothing .
He &apos;s back to his normal life .
Let &apos;s move now to a more painful subject .
He had to forgo all the farm activities .
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy .
And his wife actually took him .
So again , this is an immediate relief .
He returned again to his daily routine on the farm .
He rides his tractor .
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .
And he has been very happy .
Show us some primary cancer .
What can be done there ?
So I have good news and bad news .
The good news : there &apos;s a lot that can be done .
And doing that in the U.S.
is very painful .
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
But I have a message for the men here .
And this will take time .
This will take two years .
Women suffer from that disease .
And sometimes , they cannot even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid .
This is Frances .
This is a big fibroid .
So new life was born .
He can stop the surgery at any moment .
Kirk Citron : And now , the real news
We are drowning in news .
That &apos;s just one source .
That &apos;s the idea behind The Long News .
Or this ?
Or this ?
Really ?
Okay , that was kind of cool .
Well , let &apos;s take science .
What about global politics ?
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .
Tim Jackson : An economic reality check
And hope actually is at the heart of this .
So we &apos;re caught in a kind of trap .
Now I haven &apos;t got anything against efficiency .
How clever would we have to be ?
It &apos;s around about 770 grams of carbon .
Maybe we can do it , maybe it &apos;s possible -- who knows ?
So it looks a little bit like this .
That &apos;s called the circular flow of the economy .
It looks harmless enough .
And in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
Is this really how people are ?
Is this really how economies behave ? &quot;
And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies .
The first one is in the crisis itself .
In the crisis , in the recession , what do people want to do ?
They want to spend less and save more .
&quot; Here they are , the giraffes . &quot;
What is the objective ?
&quot; What is the objective of the consumer ? &quot;
So who are we ?
Who are these people ?
It is about opening up .
What does all this mean for economics ?
Ecosia is an Internet search engine .
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way .
And we &apos;re going to do it .
We &apos;re just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.
Investment has to be a different beast .
It has to be about transition .
What can we offer those people ?
It &apos;s clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty .
Prosperity is a shared endeavor .
So this is not about standing in the way of development .
It &apos;s not about overthrowing capitalism .
Thank you very much .
You &apos;re not making news out of things falling down .
You &apos;re making news out of the things that tell you that we &apos;re flourishing .
Can I picture politicians doing it ?
TJ : It has to be companies . It has to be civil society .
Kiran Bedi : A police chief with a difference
Now I &apos;m going to give you a story .
Let me begin with my parents .
They belonged to boys .
We were four girls and no boys .
And my parents were part of a landed property family .
Children don &apos;t choose a school .
So this is the foundation time which I got .
I grew up like this , and so did my other three sisters .
I &apos;m the only one who &apos;s left in India .
One , they said , &quot; Life is on an incline .
You can &apos;t do a thing about it .
You &apos;ve got to just respond to the situation .
Why I said this , is the background .
This is what comes next .
So I &apos;m going to move on .
This is about tough policing , equal policing .
Now I was known as &quot; here &apos;s a woman that &apos;s not going to listen . &quot;
Let &apos;s lock her up . &quot;
Here I got a prison assignment .
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals .
Obviously , it was .
And then how did I deal with them ?
I said , &quot; Do you pray ? &quot;
And they didn &apos;t say anything .
I prayed for them , and things started to change .
This is a visual of education inside the prison .
I started this with community support .
Government had no budget .
This was initiated in Delhi prison .
These are hundreds of classes .
I think that &apos;s the bigger change .
It was the beginning of a change .
Teachers were prisoners . Teachers were volunteers .
Books came from donated schoolbooks .
Stationery was donated .
That &apos;s the second landmark .
One , the numbers you &apos;ll never get to see .
Secondly , this concept .
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation .
And this is what transformed .
Let me show you the next slide .
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind .
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control .
This worked .
This is a feedback box called a petition box .
This was a magic box .
This was a sensitive box .
Let me wrap it up .
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Paul Conneally : Digital humanitarianism
And there is a major shift coming on the horizon .
Government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
Haiti was something we hadn &apos;t seen before .
This was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered .
Outside Haiti also , things were looking different .
We had basically three requirements .
We wanted to communicate in a two-way form of communication .
We wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities .
And we wanted it to be easy to use .
But does it work ?
Some 74 percent of people received the data .
96 percent of them found it useful .
And 73 percent of them shared it .
Technology is transformational .
It &apos;s on the outskirts of Nairobi , the capital city of Kenya .
You can find out about the latest impromptu music session .
You can find out about the latest security incident .
You can find out about places of worship .
You can find out about the health centers .
And they are giving a voice to themselves .
We need technology as a core organizational principle .
and convert it to humanitarian good .
We now have the tools . We now have the possibilities .
There are no more reasons not to do it .
Thank you very much .
And we call that the meme-ome .
So that &apos;s theory , that &apos;s great .
Let &apos;s see how it works in actual practice .
We might just say , well , what are the most popular talks out there ?
And a few rise to the surface .
There &apos;s a talk about gratitude .
There &apos;s another one about personal health and nutrition .
What &apos;s trending now ? What &apos;s the popular talk now ?
So this is great . It simplifies things .
It &apos;s literally defining a new field .
And apparently it smells like bacon .
I wouldn &apos;t know .
SG : So that &apos;s exactly right .
Thank you .
Alison Jackson : An unusual glimpse at celebrity
Momentum was being built .
Was she in love with him ?
Was she pregnant when she died ?
watch her horses . .
And then I was sort of making imagery .
So I &apos;m trying to penetrate that .
Well , here is the image .
Then suddenly , it started to get on front pages .
I was being asked and paid to do front covers .
But then this changed suddenly .
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers .
This was another newspaper image .
They thought it was real .
And me as the Queen .
Then I made a book .
And what is going to happen to the monarchy ?
I &apos;m not really interested in the celebrity themselves .
I &apos;m interested in the perception of the celebrity .
It &apos;s highly commercial .
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail .
Thank you .
James Watson : How we discovered DNA
And since , you know , I follow his orders , I &apos;ll do it .
But it slightly bores me .
In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17 .
I guess , you know , he was the big hero .
And that , of course , had been a question I wanted to know .
So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana .
You can read it in about two hours .
And there I met Francis Crick .
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix .
So we built a three-stranded model .
The people from London came up .
Actually , Linus didn &apos;t look at them that carefully .
And I read it , and it was just -- it was crap .
And so Bragg said , &quot; Build models . &quot;
Well , of course , I wanted to build models .
She was a crystallographer .
Well , we got the answer on the 28th February &apos; 53 .
You &apos;ve got -- the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place .
I just put them down like they were in the books .
He said they were wrong .
And we knew we were right .
From nothing to thing .
It &apos;s the order of the four bases .
So in a sense , it is a sort of digital-type information .
And you copy it by going from strand-separating .
Most scientists are really rather dull .
It was really , you know , sort of a shitty time .
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955 .
RNA provides the information for protein .
Well , at that time -- I should go back .
And we use their technique .
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer .
So the first disease he looked at is autism .
It &apos;s a wonderful way to find genes .
And yet , in the controls there were three .
So what &apos;s the meaning of the controls ?
Were they crazy also , and we didn &apos;t know it ?
Or , you know , were they normal ? I would guess they &apos;re normal .
So it &apos;s , to me , an extraordinarily exciting time .
I thank you .
Conrad Wolfram : Teaching kids real math with computers
Basically , no one &apos;s very happy .
And teachers are also frustrated .
It &apos;s actually very popular .
What &apos;s the point of teaching people math ?
And in particular , why are we teaching them math in general ?
So let &apos;s ask another question .
What is math ?
That &apos;s stage two .
And then finally , turn it back to the real world .
Did it answer the question ?
And also verify it -- crucial step .
Now here &apos;s the crazy thing right now .
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand .
But that math liberation didn &apos;t get into education yet .
It &apos;s the chore .
That &apos;s an amazing amount of human endeavor .
And I think there are some cases .
For example : mental arithmetic .
I still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating .
It &apos;s still quicker to do that and more practical .
It &apos;s a major subject .
That &apos;s absolutely the right thing , for people to follow their self-interest .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s warranted .
So what are the issues people bring up with this ?
Basics of what ?
I don &apos;t think so .
So there &apos;s another thing that comes up with basics .
Why do you think that was ? &quot;
This one kind of annoys me , I must say .
I don &apos;t think so .
When they &apos;re out of education , they do it on a computer .
This is just nuts .
All backwards .
But you see , when you &apos;re using a computer , you can just substitute .
Same principles applied -- calculations , harder .
They &apos;ve got hair all over them .
And think of the outside world .
I don &apos;t think so -- quite the opposite .
It &apos;s called programming .
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that .
And we open up so many more possibilities .
You can do so many more problems .
We want people who can feel the math instinctively .
That &apos;s what computers allow us to do .
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late .
Why is this ?
This was an example I built for my daughter .
And very , very simple .
And of course , it turns into a circle .
Very simple example .
And yet , that &apos;s a really important practical view of the world .
How many years of protection do I need ?
This isn &apos;t some optional extra .
Thanks .
Jay Bradner : Open-source cancer research
The bar is called the Miracle of Science .
The billboards say &quot; Lab Space Available . &quot;
This information is also pretty staggering .
We didn &apos;t fly him to Boston .
We didn &apos;t sequence his genome .
It &apos;s three proteins -- Ras , Myc and P53 .
And you might fairly ask : why is that ?
It &apos;s a horrible term of trade .
And this is the 21st century .
Now BRD4 is an interesting protein .
It remembers that it &apos;s cancer .
And so we started to work on this problem .
We just started mailing it to our friends .
I have a small lab .
Now this is a very rare cancer , this BRD4-addicted cancer .
They were changing shape .
This got us very excited .
The next step would be to put this molecule into mice .
And he obliged us .
And so we did just the opposite .
And this was , unfortunately , successful .
You might know that fat has memory .
Nice to be able to demonstrate that for you .
So what next ?
It &apos;s not orally available .
I want to leave you with just two ideas .
Yet this information is largely a secret .
Now the business model involves all of you .
This research is funded by the public .
It &apos;s funded by foundations .
Alison Gopnik : What do babies think ?
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot;
I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot;
On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
My son is 23 .
All right , why would we see this correlation ?
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
Boy : How about this ?
Same as the other side .
Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
I don &apos;t know .
AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
AG : Now this is his next idea .
Not working either .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
So when you put four .
AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
And I think just the opposite is true .
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
Eames Demetrios : The design genius of Charles + Ray Eames
And they were a lot of fun .
You know , Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family .
Is it because Charles and Ray made this film ?
This is the land .
It has many contrasts .
It is rough and it is flat .
In places it is cold .
In some it is hot .
But people live on this land .
Here is something of the way they live .
It was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across .
And yet , how did it start ?
So that was just a little snip .
They were always trying things out .
I &apos;m no exception .
And Charles just checking it out there .
So now we &apos;re going to go through that door of furniture .
And I &apos;m really here to talk about design .
But you know the object is just a pivot .
It &apos;s not enough to create one .
So I &apos;ve always liked this prototype picture .
Because it just kind of , you know , doesn &apos;t get any more basic than that .
You try things out .
This is a relatively famous chair .
This is something called a splint .
Now look at that plastic chair .
The house is 1949 .
The chair is done in 1949 .
They focused on the need .
They tried to solve the design problem .
It &apos;s kind of a brutal quote .
This is the earlier design of that house .
The familiar one on the lower right .
The Eames &apos; film Tops , lower left .
And a lamp that Charles designed for a church .
I want to give you one example .
So here is the tiny creature .
Design was not something other .
It was part of the business of life in general .
It was part of the quality of life .
And here is some family pictures .
So we &apos;re going to watch another film .
This is a film , the one called Toys .
Lower right is a solar do-nothing toy .
They are often the precursor to bigger things .
And now I &apos;m going to test you .
So can you read it ?
Lucia angel , okay , eye .
Audience : Saw many trains .
Also , what is he doing ? Row , rowed .
Dawn , very good .
Also rode on one . I ...
So , I hope you had a Audience : Nice time , time -- ED : Time at .
Citizen Kane , rose -- Audience : Rosebud .
ED : Okay , good .
So you guys did pretty good , cool .
It &apos;s sort of an alternative universe .
It &apos;s kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape .
Those plaques are plaques we &apos;ve been installing around North America .
So , of course , since it &apos;s bronze it has to be true .
And so we had spelling bees in Paris , Illinois .
Your word is N. Carolina .
Girl : Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A .
And the town has really embraced it .
We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club .
And we could have been born 100,000 years ago .
And you &apos;re kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica .
The Tahatchabe , the great road building culture .
But now I &apos;m going to return you to the real world .
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition .
Silent . We don &apos;t have a track for it yet .
And you try something out .
But here is what &apos;s really great .
Now we &apos;re going to do some movies . &quot;
So we &apos;re going to do the last clip .
So this is Charles &apos; voice .
If you &apos;re up the scale a little bit more , why , a brass thali .
And then things get to be a little questionable .
There are things like silver-plated thalis .
And there is solid silver thalis .
But you can go beyond that .
And I also want to share this one .
That &apos;s what we all need to do .
I really thank you for your time .
Bill Doyle : Treating cancer with electric fields
And they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer .
And electric fields are not magnetism .
What electric fields are are a field of forces .
We can all picture astronauts in space .
They begin to be attracted towards Earth .
We &apos;re , of course , all stuck in the Earth &apos;s gravitational field right now .
That &apos;s why you &apos;re all in your chairs .
And we can observe this .
And we can see them dividing throughout .
The one within the circle manages .
The one up there can &apos;t divide at all .
It &apos;s a death sentence .
We divided the patients into two groups .
And five years ago , Robert was diagnosed with GBM .
He received the standard treatments .
He received surgery .
He received high dose radiation to the head .
And he received first-line chemotherapy .
He entered our trial .
First of all , these electrodes are noninvasive .
There &apos;s none of the tiredness .
There &apos;s none of what is called the &quot; chemo head . &quot;
There &apos;s no sensation .
It doesn &apos;t interfere with computers or electrical equipment .
This is a therapy that takes time to work .
It &apos;s still there .
And every single morning I appreciate life .
Lydia &apos;s a 66 year-old farmer in Switzerland .
She was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago .
Her cancer continued to grow .
She is managing her farm .
She &apos;s interacting with her kids and her grand kids .
It &apos;s only the beginning .
Thank you .
Yves Rossy : Fly with the Jetman
He &apos;s acting as a human fuselage , so to say .
And that &apos;s quite unique .
When he arches his back , he gains altitude .
There is Yves Rossy .
Commentator Two : It looks like he &apos;s stabilized .
He &apos;s starting to make his climb .
He &apos;s out over the channel .
There is Yves Rossy .
There is no turning back now .
Ladies and gentlemen , an historic flight has begun .
Commentator : There he is .
Yves Rossy has landed in England .
And now he &apos;s in Edinburgh . Yves Rossy .
And his equipment as well .
Yves , welcome . It is quite amazing .
And there were many , many others .
So it &apos;s possible to fly almost like a bird .
What is it &#91; like &#93; to be up there ?
Yves Rossy : It &apos;s fun . It &apos;s fun .
I don &apos;t have feathers .
But I feel like a bird sometimes .
How did you start to become Jetman ?
When you go out of an airplane you are almost naked .
You take a position like that .
And that &apos;s the nearest thing to the dream .
You have no machine around you .
You are just in the element .
It &apos;s very short and only in one direction .
So I &apos;m kind of curious , what &apos;s your top speed ?
YR : It &apos;s about 300 km per hour before looping .
That means about 190 miles per hour .
And what &apos;s the weight of the equipment you &apos;re carrying ?
I have 55 kilos on my back .
And you &apos;re not piloting ?
There is no handle , no steering nothing ?
And I wanted to keep this freedom of movement .
And it &apos;s really like the kid playing the airplane .
I want to go down like that .
And up I climb , I turn .
It &apos;s really pure flying .
It &apos;s not steering , it &apos;s flight .
What kind of training do you do , you personally , for that ?
YR : Actually , I try to stay just fit .
I don &apos;t do special physical training .
Just , I try to keep my mobility through new activities .
So you have to adapt .
So Breitling &apos;s four engines .
YR : Yeah , two-meter span .
Ultrastable profile .
Harness , parachute .
So just check before it &apos;s finished .
And yeah , that &apos;s all .
Two parachutes .
And this is my life .
That &apos;s the real important thing about safety .
But most probably I did something like that .
Something that is not very safe in image .
So the next thing I saw was just blue .
It was the sea .
And then I did open my chute .
I see . Maybe come back here .
This is risky stuff indeed .
I assume you have standards .
YR : Yeah . I have no checklist for that .
Let &apos;s not tell you employer .
YR : No , that &apos;s really two worlds .
Civil aviation is something that we know very well .
We have a hundred years of experience .
And you can adapt really precisely .
That means improvise .
So plan B , always a plan B.
That &apos;s my ejection seat .
It &apos;s well said . It &apos;s well said .
YR : I do a roll .
YR : It was down on the bottom .
That &apos;s exactly why I asked the question .
YR : I have a standard answer .
Perfect answer .
Yves , one last question .
I want to share it , to do formation flights .
So instead of jumping off a plane , yes ?
Really , I go step by step .
It seems a little bit crazy , but it &apos;s not .
Yves , thank you very much . Yves Rossy .
James B. Glattfelder : Who controls the world ?
But this is different .
It gets worse .
Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
I ended up in physics by accident .
In a nutshell , you can think of physics as follows .
You encode it into equations .
Then predictions can be made and tested .
These are just a few examples .
So what do we know about complex systems ?
Where are economic networks ?
What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
Are they interconnected ?
And what is the overall distribution of control ?
In other words , who controls the world ?
I think this is an interesting question .
This is the TNC network which we analyzed .
And it turns out to be structured as follows .
Well , ownership gives voting rights to shareholders .
This is the normal notion of control .
And the network really matters .
You get the idea .
It &apos;s actually not that hard to understand .
Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
And it gets even more extreme .
It &apos;s not a street map . &quot;
And this is slowly starting .
Now there is still a big problem , in my opinion .
Thank you .
Zainab Salbi : Women , wartime and the dream of peace
It was deep at night .
I do not remember what time it was .
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking .
This is my story .
I was that girl .
We only talk about one side of it .
It &apos;s like dying from inside-out .
We have been only seeing one side of war .
This is the language of sterility .
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children .
How interesting .
How interesting .
These just become numbers that we refer to .
It is a chess game .
Checkmate .
We are missing a completely other side of wars .
That was her fight .
That was her resistance .
And the ones who are keeping that life are women .
There are two sides of war .
Not one , but 50 percent .
She got into Women for Women International &apos;s program .
She got a support network .
She learned about her rights .
She was earning 450 dollars . She was doing okay .
I will meet you there .
Let us make this field a much bigger place .
Let us all meet in that field .
Thank you .
Jessica Green : Are we filtering the wrong microbes ?
And we looked at three different types of rooms .
And we also sampled the outdoor air .
Why does this matter ?
I &apos;ve heard somebody say that you &apos;re as healthy as your gut .
Thank you .
Bill Gates : Teachers need real feedback
Everyone needs a coach .
Sorry , Sharon . Here you go .
We all need people who will give us feedback .
That &apos;s how we improve .
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
How would I know who was the best ?
Our teachers deserve better .
The system we have today isn &apos;t fair to them .
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
We &apos;re not even in the top 10 .
We &apos;re tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland .
Eleven out of 14 .
Some teachers are far more effective than others .
What would that system look like ?
For example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea ?
&quot; Do you learn to correct your mistakes ? &quot;
And what we found is very exciting .
So it tells us we &apos;re asking the right questions .
Sarah Brown Wessling : Good morning everybody .
To get started , we &apos;re doing a peer review day , okay ?
My name is Sarah Brown Wessling .
Turn to somebody next to you .
It doesn &apos;t catch every little thing that &apos;s going on .
And I &apos;m able to learn a lot from it .
All right , let &apos;s take a look at the long one first , okay ?
If I don &apos;t write things down , I don &apos;t remember them .
Alrighty , everybody , have a great weekend .
I &apos;ll see you later .
But we still have more work to do .
Building this system will also require a considerable investment .
The impact for teachers would be phenomenal .
It would also make us a more fair and just one , too .
I hope you are too .
Thank you .
Pico Iyer : Where is home ?
Where do you come from ?
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
means &quot; Where do you pay your taxes ?
Where do you see your doctor and your dentist ? &quot;
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
Home for them is really a work in progress .
You can &apos;t take anything for granted .
So they become friends . They fall in love .
They move to New York City .
Or Edinburgh .
It &apos;s the place where you become yourself .
This was the wrong answer .
Several lifetimes , actually .
He found himself .
I didn &apos;t consult the monks for guidance .
That &apos;s not the point .
It &apos;s the place where you stand .
Thank you .
Mena Trott : Meet the founder of the blog revolution
But then I started thinking about my family .
So , who am I ?
We have about 125 people internationally .
I am not that caring .
You can laugh , this is OK .
This is me .
This is what happened to me .
How much money does he spend on beer in a year ?
Why don &apos;t you open a separate account ? &quot;
And then I got people saying , &quot; Leave him . &quot;
And why are they reading this ? &quot;
I don &apos;t want to write for this public audience .
And I started to kill my blog slowly .
But anyways .
His father was a blogger .
And he never expected this .
And this is a one-pound baby .
So Odin was documented every single day .
Pictures were taken every day : day one , day two ...
And you see this post .
So , blogs .
And so , that &apos;s an amazing thing to consider .
So , that has always influenced me .
That was an amazing thing .
And that &apos;s a huge thing .
So , thank you .
James Geary : Metaphorically speaking
Metaphor lives a secret life all around us .
We utter about six metaphors a minute .
I am , of course , referring to none other than Elvis Presley .
Lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
This is the mathematics of metaphor .
And fortunately it &apos;s very simple .
X equals Y.
This formula works wherever metaphor is present .
So , how do we make and understand metaphors ?
This might look familiar .
The first step is pattern recognition .
Look at this image . What do you see ?
Second step , conceptual synesthesia .
We all have synesthetic abilities .
This is the Bouba / Kiki test .
Can we do a quick show of hands ?
Does that correspond ?
Okay , I think 99.9 would about cover it .
Why do we do that ?
And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic .
Silence is sweet .
Neckties are loud .
Sexually attractive people are hot .
Sexually unattractive people leave us cold .
Third step is cognitive dissonance .
This is the Stroop test .
You can take the test now .
Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well .
One of the sentences was , &quot; Some jobs are jails . &quot;
Sadly , it &apos;s metaphorically true .
Metaphor matters because it creates expectations .
Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news .
That &apos;s a hypothetical example of course .
But this is how metaphor misleads .
And they had to make a decision .
What should they do ?
Intervene , appeal to the U.N. , or do nothing ?
Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery .
Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play .
Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as &quot; fossil poetry . &quot;
And these fossils still breathe .
But there is a better translation .
So , the original meaning of &quot; cogito &quot; is to shake together .
Thank you very much .
Chris Abani : On humanity
So it wasn &apos;t just me , there was a whole generation of us .
In South Africa , they have a phrase called Ubuntu .
It &apos;s really very simple , but really very complicated .
And she was dark , too .
My mother was English .
It &apos;s totally rad . &quot;
I said , &quot; English , mum . &quot;
But her Igbo wasn &apos;t too good .
So she took me along to translate .
I was seven .
And , &quot; Do you notice any discharges ? &quot;
And , &quot; How swollen is your vulva ? &quot;
My mother said , &quot; Someone has to . &quot;
It was my mother with five little children .
And she told this woman .
Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you .
But today , women are rebuilding Rwanda .
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us .
And I was supposed to do this alone .
So , this guy comes with me .
Anyway , a goat &apos;s eyes are like a child &apos;s eyes .
I was a wimp .
I cried for a very long time .
And afterwards , he didn &apos;t say a word .
He just sat there watching me cry for an hour .
So , I was born two days after Christmas .
And my mother said , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about that in front of guests . &quot;
Take anything you want out of the suitcase .
It &apos;s your birthday present . &quot;
There were some really bad people there .
He was obsessed .
It &apos;s incredible .
I was really worried .
He didn &apos;t know what death row meant .
Then I &apos;d say , &quot; How do you know ? &quot;
They killed him .
All around us , everywhere , there are people like this .
This is how they came to reclaim their humanity .
It doesn &apos;t require a tremendous thing .
&quot; Libation , North Carolina , 1999 .
I offer to this ground , this gin .
I call a name that could be his .
This is for you , old man .
This gin , this salty earth . &quot;
Thank you .
In fact , they make their livings on this kind of stuff .
But this isn &apos;t even about Reddit itself .
It &apos;s actually about humpback whales .
These humpback whales were getting killed .
I believe this is a Farsi word for &quot; immortal . &quot;
And then there was this : Mister Splashy Pants .
So , the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves .
Well , that got us a little angry .
So , we changed it to Fightin &apos; Splashy .
So , there was a clear lesson here .
Greenpeace was thrilled . The whales were happy . That &apos;s a quote .
And this is kind of how the Internet works .
That is , as long as you can keep net neutrality in place .
Thank you .
Temple Grandin : The world needs all kinds of minds
You wouldn &apos;t have any ...
It &apos;s a continuum of traits .
You have to get away from verbal language .
I think in pictures , I don &apos;t think in language .
And the thing is , the normal brain ignores the details .
People are getting away from doing hands-on stuff .
Rapid movement , contrast .
My mind works like Google for images .
I thought everybody thought in pictures .
I see only specific pictures .
OK , how about famous ones ?
And they just kind of come up , kind of like this .
Just really quickly , like Google for pictures .
That was like just so super cool .
This is tensor imaging .
More abstract . These are your engineers , your computer programmers .
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it .
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading .
You &apos;ll see these different kinds of minds .
Now , another thing is the sensory issues .
You know , it &apos;s going to be variable .
He knows who &apos;s been there , when they were there .
There &apos;s a ton of information on that fire hydrant .
Cattle are the same way .
You see , it &apos;s a different picture .
Or do I have something wrong with the equipment ? &quot;
In other words , categorize equipment problem from a people problem .
Or is the whole design of the system wrong ?
People have a hard time figuring that out .
Yeah , I &apos;m a million-mile flier .
It would be their airplane tails .
It &apos;s tails , pure and simple .
White cowboy hats , that was absolutely fine .
We &apos;ve got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds .
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie .
And they &apos;re not going down the right path .
This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller .
And let &apos;s talk about jobs .
But you know what ? I was getting work experience .
I was taught that when I was eight years old .
My mother said , &quot; Well let &apos;s do a picture of something else . &quot;
Let &apos;s say the kid is fixated on Legos .
Let &apos;s get him working on building different things .
It just drives me crazy .
What can visual thinkers do when they grow up ?
It &apos;s just kind of -- you just have to learn it .
And we need to be working with these students .
And this brings up mentors .
He was a NASA space scientist .
We need to be doing that .
You &apos;re getting that kid turned on .
Mentors are just essential .
And we &apos;ve got to mentor them , hire them .
That &apos;s the kind of specificity you need .
Well , that &apos;s the end of my talk .
And I just want to thank everybody for coming .
It was great to be here .
Oh , you &apos;ve got a question for me ? OK .
Thank you so much for that .
TG : Well , first of all , you &apos;ve got to look at age .
I got social interaction through shared interest .
That was like , we considered that super cool .
What are you most passionate about ?
How many cattle got poked with the prodder ?
How many cattle are mooing their heads off ?
And it &apos;s very , very simple .
You directly observe a few simple things .
It &apos;s libraries .
And this is before the Internet got really big .
TG : Well thank you so much . Thank you .
This is Revolution 2.0 .
Because everyone was a hero .
Everyone has done something .
We all use Wikipedia .
Everything was going bad .
Everything was going wrong .
In fact , people were extremely frustrated .
Everyone was scared .
But in fact , the majority were scared .
Everyone did not want really to get in trouble .
A dictator cannot live without the force .
They want to make people live in fear .
It &apos;s helping all of us to connect .
There are a lot of people who are frustrated . &quot;
There are lots of people who are frustrated .
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
They probably have the best life in the world .
They are happy . They don &apos;t have problems .
It was an educational campaign .
I still remember the photo .
The photo was horrible .
He was tortured , brutally tortured to death .
But then what was the answer of the regime ?
He &apos;s someone who escaped from all these bad things . &quot;
But people did not relate to this .
People did not believe this .
He was a middle-class guy .
His photo was remembered by all of us .
A page was created .
&quot; What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
Get those who killed this guy .
To just bring them to justice . &quot;
But of course , they don &apos;t listen .
Everyone was an owner in this page .
People started contributing ideas .
And next time it &apos;s going to be vibration . &quot;
People were making fun of the idea .
And they were doing this thing .
They were actually attacking them .
There was no leader .
Yes we can . We can do it .
The revolution is happening .
I was detained on the 27th night .
But they detained me .
I was not allowed to speak with anyone .
And I went out .
The next day I was in Tahrir .
The fear is no longer fear .
It &apos;s actually strength -- it &apos;s power .
People were so empowered .
Completely opposite .
Extremism became tolerance .
I said that , &quot; We are going to win .
We are going to win because we don &apos;t understand politics .
We &apos;re going to win because we don &apos;t have an agenda .
We &apos;re going to win because we have dreams .
For me that &apos;s winning , regardless of all the details .
Thanks a lot .
Dean Ornish : Healing through diet
To me , that &apos;s the real natural wonder .
And it &apos;s not a diet .
You just never know .
It &apos;s important , but not enough .
Well , because it helps them get through the day .
And the pain is not the problem : it &apos;s the symptom .
The most effective anti-smoking ad was this one .
Viagra , right ? Why ? Because a lot of guys need it .
And yet , look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold .
Your sexual function improves .
When you eat a big fatty meal , how do you feel ?
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards .
And just to show you this , this is from the CDC .
Mississippi , more than 25 percent of people are overweight .
Why is this ? Well , this is one way to lose weight that works very well ...
but it doesn &apos;t last , which is the problem .
The other way is to change the type of food .
Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down , which is good .
But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat .
So , and you get all the disease-protective substances .
And these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids .
You find these , for example , in fish oil .
He says , &quot; I &apos;ve got some good news .
So when you go on these kinds of diet , they begin to smell bad .
And in order for the PSA to go down , they had to make pretty big changes .
And depression is treatable . We need to do something about that .
And it &apos;s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do .
Other studies have shown this as well .
Thank you .
The big residual is always value for money .
If you have money , of course , you can get the value .
But if you don &apos;t have money , what happens ?
They believe that things can be done .
Let me confirm what she said .
That &apos;s how I &apos;m standing before you .
So that is the House of Tata .
Innovation , compassion and passion .
They combine all that .
And you can see the cartoon here .
And incredible car .
We &apos;ll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment . &quot;
Stretch the envelope . &quot;
Can you believe it ?
Until midnight , he &apos;d be thinking .
But who was the team leader ?
And the Nano team average age was just 27 years .
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time .
Adhesives were replacing the rivets .
All ideas on board were welcome .
I mean , it was incredible innovation .
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors .
All the time , you have been given an envelope .
And therefore , each component had to have a dual functionality .
The length is smaller by eight percent by the way .
Volkswagon was 11,333 .
And British Motor was around 11,000 .
And Nano was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
And those dreams are getting fulfilled .
The driver &apos;s name is Naran .
He has bought his own Nano .
What is its price ? 20,000 dollars .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s not the case in India .
And they climb up for their work .
A challenge , of course .
You just don &apos;t have it .
And therefore , you ought to look at alternatives .
&quot; Did it hurt ? &quot;
&quot; No ... not at all . &quot;
So that &apos;s what it is all about .
An incredible story .
Let &apos;s move on to something else .
Let &apos;s move to health .
What &apos;s happening in the area of health ?
10 years ago , it used to cost about a quarter billion .
Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars .
No , I &apos;m sorry .
We used to have 40 , now they have come down to 30 .
Let us just take an example .
Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin .
The cost of treatment , 20,000 dollars .
Time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
For example , we don &apos;t want 20,000 dollars ; we don &apos;t have it .
Can we do it &#91; for &#93; 100 dollars ?
Time for development , not 10 years .
We are in a hurry . Five years .
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars .
Sorry . I can &apos;t spend more than 10 million dollars .
Looks absolutely audacious .
Looks absolutely ridiculous .
These targets have been achieved in India .
And how they have been achieved ...
And that is how this difference has come .
You can see before treatment and after treatment .
It &apos;s not about low cost .
It &apos;s about ultra-low cost .
You &apos;re talking about inclusive innovation .
I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day .
You know , incubators for infants , for example .
They &apos;re not available in Africa .
They &apos;re not available in Indian villages .
And infants die .
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars .
And by whom ?
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering .
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes .
I &apos;ve still one and a half to go .
What was that ?
&#91; In the &#93; 20th century , we gave Gandhi to the world .
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering .
Lakshmi Pratury : Thank you , Dr. Mashelkar .
LP : A quick question for you .
What do you think that drove you ?
And there was a bright spot up there .
And then he said , &quot; This is the focal length . &quot;
And then the paper burned .
But more importantly , focus and you can achieve .
What does that focal length do ?
It has parallel lines , which are sun rays .
What does that convex lens do ?
It makes them meet .
This is convex lens leadership .
They divide them farther .
LP : Thank you very much .
Steven Pinker : What our language habits reveal
The problem is , which verbs go in which constructions ?
The verb is the chassis of the sentence .
For example , the dative construction in English .
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways .
This would be an example of how to do that .
Unfortunately , there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions .
Only humans can possess things .
So why should anyone care ?
You can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; mentalese . &quot;
&quot; The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul . &quot;
This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language .
No one &apos;s fooled .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Now , relationship types can be negotiated .
In less blatant cases , there &apos;s still a kind of negotiation that often goes on .
Well , what does this have to do with language ?
The simplest example of this is in the polite request .
On the other hand , you want the damn guacamole .
Nothing ventured , nothing gained .
In that case , the consequences are rather severe .
So this is a rather fraught situation .
So you get the best of both worlds .
Thank you very much .
Charles Leadbeater : The era of open innovation
That &apos;s 58 billion dollars .
They can say &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; to the invention .
That &apos;s the idea of creativity .
More special people , more special places .
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers .
Well this view , I think , is increasingly wrong .
Why is that ?
So , you &apos;re in a big corporation .
.
They work at their leisure , if you like .
Consumption , in that sense , is an expression of their productive potential .
And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
The users can be producers .
This is open ; this is closed .
This is new ; this is traditional .
Let me just give you two examples .
There &apos;ll be huge professional arguments as well .
They &apos;re not reading my brilliant article ! &quot;
Those were the two places .
They want to be part of that flow of information .
So , there &apos;s going to be a tremendous struggle .
The first is : can we really survive on volunteers ?
What &apos;s the role of the BBC , for instance , in that world ?
What should be the role of public policy ?
500 people .
Because basically , he doesn &apos;t service them .
You &apos;ve got two options .
That costs about 100 dollars .
Thank you very much .
Richard Sears : Planning for the end of oil
It &apos;s great stuff .
But this is it , this is the oil in the world .
But there &apos;s actually more to the story than that .
Now , it &apos;s about 35 percent .
And what goes on in the future ?
Here &apos;s a piece of limestone .
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls , Texas .
It &apos;s about 400 million years old .
Now , here &apos;s a piece of chalk .
Yeah , it &apos;s very different -- no , it &apos;s not different .
This is pretty incredible stuff .
All the same , what &apos;s different ?
Now , what does this have to do with energy ?
Here &apos;s a piece of coal .
And so that is my story .
The oil will never run out .
It &apos;s not because we have a lot of it .
Thank you very much .
Kamal Meattle : How to grow fresh air
Why is this important ?
And thank you for listening .
And then there was me , the Iranian-American of the group .
Those two countries aren &apos;t getting along these days .
These are dilemmas I have every day .
So I remember getting my American passport .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to go places . &quot;
&quot; Ah ha ! American , great . &quot;
And he started asking me questions .
He said , &quot; What is your father &apos;s name ? &quot;
He goes , &quot; What is your grandfather &apos;s name ? &quot;
I said , &quot; He passed away a long time ago .
His name was Jabbar . &quot;
You owe us two billion dollars . &quot;
Like I think you &apos;re missing the point here .
I want to play a bad guy . I want to rob a bank .
&quot; Why would I do that ?
Right .
&quot; Well , then blow yourself up .
Just do it outside , please . &quot;
But the fact is , there &apos;s good people everywhere .
&quot; I didn &apos;t get the memo . What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
&quot; We just wanted to say we tried . &quot;
&quot; And furthermore , it is the thought that counts . &quot;
&quot; And in conclusion , win some , lose some . &quot;
Don &apos;t be Hassan . Don &apos;t be Hussein . &quot;
That &apos;s not one of us . &quot;
&quot; Damn it ! Why Jack ? Why ? &quot;
I just did a seven-country solo tour .
I was in Oman , and I was in Saudi Arabia .
I was in Dubai .
And it &apos;s great , there &apos;s good people everywhere .
I encourage people always to go visit these places .
For example , Dubai -- cool place .
They have a mall there , the Dubai Mall .
It is so big , they have taxis in the mall .
I was walking . I heard &quot; Beep , beep . &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
It &apos;s like a drug deal .
I was walking by . The guy goes , &quot; Psst . Habibi , my friend . &quot;
&quot; You want some frozen yogurt ?
Come here . Come here . Come here .
Not in the Middle East .
I went down . I go , &quot; Where &apos;s my son ? &quot;
&quot; On the third floor , sir . On the third floor . &quot;
&quot; You take a taxi . You go to Zara . Make a left . &quot;
And I &apos;ve been guilty of stereotyping as well .
I was in Dubai . And there &apos;s a lot of Indians who work in Dubai .
And they don &apos;t get paid that well .
I go , &quot; He &apos;s got to be my driver . &quot;
He goes , &quot; No , sir . I own the hotel . &quot;
&quot; My name is Bond , Jamal Bond . &quot;
Have a good day . Thank you .
Stefana Broadbent : How the Internet enables intimacy
And what do I mean by that ?
One young woman brought her grandfather .
Now , lets take some data . Facebook .
And when you go to Skype , it &apos;s down to two people .
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed .
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples .
The first gentleman , he &apos;s a baker .
And so he starts working every morning at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Then there is another couple , there is a Brazilian couple .
They &apos;ve lived in Italy for a number of years .
And then there is the third couple . They are two friends .
They chat to each other every day , a few times a day actually .
And now , obviously , they have it open .
So , none of these cases are unique .
But what is really exceptional is the setting .
But it could be in a school , it could be an administration , it could be a hospital .
Maybe you had a direct line .
If you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
And it had nothing to do with technical capability .
That was where the focus had to be .
And then the school enacts perfectly well .
So , until then , basically people were living on top of their trades .
They were living on top of the land they were laboring .
And actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
And they are doing it massively .
I really think that the number is conservative .
100 percent are using text .
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook .
Terry Moore : How to tie your shoes
And I think that &apos;s true .
Now I know that seems ludicrous .
I know that seems ludicrous .
Now as it turns out -- thank you .
Wait , there &apos;s more .
And here &apos;s how to tell .
That &apos;s the weak form of the knot .
But not to worry .
We &apos;re going to do this one more time .
Start as usual , go the other way around the loop .
Pull the knot .
There it is : the strong form of the shoe knot .
Live long and prosper .
Roger Ebert : Remaking my voice
It was like breathing .
In those days , I was living in a fool &apos;s paradise .
I used to be able to talk like that .
I will start with my wife , Chaz .
CE : I was optimistic , and all was right with the world .
The first surgery was a great success .
Two weeks later , I was ready to return home .
Suddenly , I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding .
My carotid artery had ruptured .
So thank you , Leonard Cohen , for saving my life .
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ?
How did I feel not being able to speak ?
At first I was against it .
But I decided then to just give it a try .
But they were willing to give it a try .
And it sounded like me , it really did .
There was a reason for that ; it was me .
But it wasn &apos;t that simple .
I &apos;ll let you hear a sample of that voice .
or Roger 2.0 .
This is the first version of my computer voice .
The flow isn &apos;t natural .
A very large sample is needed .
John Hunter : All my life I was a motormouth .
That has mostly happened in my lifetime .
It was about 1960 .
But that &apos;s not the point .
But I &apos;m not here from the Chamber of Commerce .
I &apos;m here as a man who wants to communicate .
Does anybody remember that ? &quot;
It is unimaginable what will happen next .
They give me a way to speak .
Not everybody has the patience of my wife , Chaz .
But online , everybody speaks at the same speed .
This whole adventure has been a learning experience .
Now I have no jaw left at all .
But no you don &apos;t .
People -- People talk loudly -- I &apos;m so sorry .
Excuse me .
People talk loudly and slowly to me .
Sometimes they assume I am deaf .
There are people who don &apos;t want to make eye contact .
So I have not come here to complain .
I seem , for the time being , to be cancer-free .
I am writing as well as ever .
I am productive .
A guy goes into a psychiatrist .
The psychiatrist says , &quot; You &apos;re crazy . &quot;
The guy says , &quot; I want a second opinion . &quot;
The psychiatrist says , &quot; All right , you &apos;re ugly . &quot;
James Burchfield : Playing invisible turntables
Let &apos;s just get started here .
Okay , just a moment .
All right .
Oh , sorry .
Thank you .
Steven Cowley : Fusion is energy &apos;s future
It &apos;s really been a long time since we &apos;ve known about fusion .
I &apos;ve always been very worried about resource .
And as a child you &apos;re always worried about resource .
Energy , at the moment , is dominated by resource .
And those resources are going away .
Fission .
Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations .
But there is a catch . Of course there is always a catch in these cases .
Fusion is very hard to do .
We &apos;ve been trying for 50 years .
I was a strange child .
Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason .
It &apos;s a medium-sized nucleus .
So , uranium , which is very big , wants to split .
And you can get energy out this way .
And indeed that &apos;s exactly what stars do .
So , most of the time they repel .
And that energy is what powers fusion .
And it &apos;s this reaction that we want to do .
There is one trickiness about this reaction .
You have to make it from something else .
And that &apos;s the way you make your tritium .
Now , why the hell would we bother to do this ?
This is basically why we would bother to do it .
And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate .
And then we get to uranium .
Is it cost-competitive ?
We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant .
And we get within about the same price as current electricity .
So , how would we make it ?
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees .
And , in fact , we &apos;ve done this .
We hold it with a magnetic field .
And in fact we can make fusion happen .
And just down the road , this is JET .
This is the device we &apos;re building now .
It gets very expensive to do this research .
Seven nations are involved in building this .
But that &apos;s not electricity yet .
We have to get to this .
We have to get to a power plant .
We have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology .
And I &apos;d really like it to happen a lot faster than it is .
I wish this were different . We really need it now .
So 2030 looks like an infinity away .
I wish we had more money , I wish we had more resources .
There were no clouds in the sky .
And after a while I began to perspire .
That &apos;s part of you up there .
My hair used to be straight .
I &apos;m just kidding .
They become lovely monsters .
What is your motive for action ?
All of us here have great minds .
What makes the difference in their performance ? &quot;
Because that &apos;s what I got hired to do .
I &apos;ve got to produce the result now .
How do you make a change ?
How do you take what you &apos;re dreaming of and make it happen ?
Because science is easy , right ?
But when it comes to fulfillment -- that &apos;s an art .
And what I mean by that is the mindset that we are our past .
Audience : Aye .
Thanks for the interaction on a high level there .
Supreme Court .
And you correct me if I &apos;m wrong .
But , how easy for me to tell him what he should do .
Audience : Aye .
Audience : Yes .
The story people tell us is a bunch of different stories .
Next one , please . He &apos;s broken my pattern , that son-of-a-bitch .
But I appreciated the energy , I &apos;ll tell you that .
Right now , you have to decide what you &apos;re going to focus on .
An emotion , then , creates what we &apos;re going to do or the action .
Audience : Aye .
The history of our world is these decisions .
You &apos;ve got it in your brain ; you &apos;ve got it in your lungs .
But what was his decision of what to focus on ?
Different than most people . What did it mean ?
We all have had time .
Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
Your model of the world is the filter . That &apos;s what &apos;s shaping us .
That &apos;s what makes people make decisions .
And it &apos;s made up of three parts , I believe .
How many have been there ? Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
And then there &apos;s the fuel you pick . So very quickly , six needs .
Let me tell you what they are . First one : certainty .
We need variety . We need surprise .
How many of you here love surprises ? Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
Bullshit . You like the surprises you want .
Who knows what &apos;s going to happen next ? Kind of exciting .
And you &apos;re going to get hurt again .
Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves .
It &apos;s been fantastic .
Thank you .
The last thing is emotion .
How may know somebody like this ? Come on .
10 seconds .
Thank you . I hope this was of service .
Vik Muniz : Art with wire , sugar , chocolate and string
Creativity is how we cope with creation .
See , for instance , in this picture .
I just did things .
You didn &apos;t trust information very much .
Luckily , it wasn &apos;t fatal , as you can all see .
The first works were actually objects .
And I called them relics .
This is the clown skull .
They lived in Brazil , long time ago .
This is the Ashanti joystick .
The rocking podium .
This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker .
The Bonsai table .
And the half tombstone , for people who are not dead yet .
So I decided to do work with clouds .
But I was still , you know -- this is a kitty cloud .
&quot; The Snail . &quot;
&quot; The Teapot . &quot;
And he did something that was very tricky .
And it &apos;s totally overkill .
And your eye doesn &apos;t know which level to read .
And you become trapped into this kind of representation .
&quot; Relaxation . &quot;
&quot; Fiat Lux . &quot;
And I wanted to deal with other subjects .
So this is a lighthouse .
And I don &apos;t know how many yards , after John Constable .
I got some photographs from them .
&quot; Valicia . &quot;
&quot; Jacynthe . &quot;
But another layer of representation was still introduced .
So they &apos;re called &quot; Pictures of Chocolate . &quot;
And Jackson Pollock also .
&quot; Paparazzi . &quot;
And I picked minimalist pieces because they &apos;re about specificity .
This is Richard Serra .
I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet &apos;s &quot; Haystacks . &quot;
This is a pipe .
A hanger .
So they &apos;re like perfect actors .
Well , I think that &apos;s it .
My time is nearly up .
Thank you very much .
Greg Stone : Saving the ocean one island at a time
I needed to put it into a context .
I needed to head towards conservation goals .
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica .
So where are the Phoenix Islands ?
It &apos;s out in the middle of the Pacific , right around the Equator .
They &apos;ve never been dived . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yeah .
But I was in for the adventure .
It &apos;s a very deep-water part of our planet .
The average depths are about 12,000 ft .
Seamounts are important for biodiversity .
It &apos;s an interesting fact .
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts .
Let &apos;s try there , &quot; and then falling into the water .
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location .
And we finished our trip .
And that &apos;s the area again .
And what &apos;s the context of the Phoenix Islands ?
Where do these exist ?
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands .
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands .
It &apos;s the largest atoll nation in the world .
And he says , &quot; cause that &apos;s where all the money is . &quot;
Because that &apos;s where all the ocean is . &quot;
Some of the islands have already gone under water .
We as a world are faced with a problem .
So it &apos;s something we need to focus on .
So I said , &quot; Okay , I &apos;m happy to buy lunch .
Just get whatever anybody wants . &quot;
And are you free for dinner ? &quot;
He coined the term &quot; reverse fishing license . &quot;
And it certainly was .
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .
You can read them yourselves .
How do we realize Sylvia &apos;s dream ?
Where eventually do we take this ?
Thank you very much .
Jake Barton : The museum of you
This is Charley Williams .
He was 94 when this photograph was taken .
The idea is very , very simple .
I &apos;m going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project .
You can see it in Pedro .
So I &apos;m going to share a mic with you right now , Debora .
Where &apos;s the right finger ?
Debora Brakarz : MW : Debora , will you please marry me ?
DB : Yes . Of course . I love you .
He used to pick people up here every day .
So it seems right .
This is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel .
Voice 7 : It was probably about 11 o &apos;clock at night .
My business partner told me to turn on the television .
Voice 15 : So I switched on the television .
Voice 17 : The Twin Towers . Voice 18 : The Twin Towers .
This is the so-called slurry wall .
&quot; How could 9 / 11 have happened ? &quot;
&quot; And how did the world change after 9 / 11 ? &quot;
Thank you very much .
Stacey Kramer : The best gift I ever survived
Imagine , if you will -- a gift .
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big -- about the size of a golf ball .
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you .
You &apos;ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
You &apos;ll eat countless gourmet meals .
Flowers will arrive by the truckload .
Your life will have new meaning .
Peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana .
The price ?
$ 55,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible deal .
Does Amazon carry it ?
Does it have the Apple logo on it ?
Is there a waiting list ?
Not likely .
This gift came to me about five months ago .
And this , and then this .
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
Rory Stewart : Time to end the war in Afghanistan
Why are we spending $ 135 billion ?
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground ?
How has this happened ?
So the question is : What are we doing ?
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan ?
All of this is wrong .
Every one of those statements is wrong .
They simply don &apos;t have a conventional military option .
Because this isn &apos;t the 1990s anymore .
Today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
There was amazing improvements .
And we had progress in the free media .
And the same is true for the troops .
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj .
Today , he could never do that .
Now is this a new idea ?
And yet , nobody listened to them .
Well guess what ? It didn &apos;t .
How do we allow any of this to happen ?
You feel deep , deep guilt .
What is the solution to this ?
And there was not a single Pashto speaker .
So we need to change that institutional culture .
And thirdly , we need to have some humility .
It isn &apos;t .
A million properties have been returned .
The national army has shrunk .
But you need to look at context .
We &apos;re not matching our resources to our priorities .
Why mountain rescue ?
This is the wrong way of looking at it .
It &apos;s about context .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Rory , you mentioned Libya at the end .
And we are always being tempted up to our neck .
We could have done that .
Rory , thank you very much .
RS : Thank you .
Geoff Mulgan : A short intro to the Studio School
What I want to talk about today is one idea .
And the design we came up with had the following characteristics .
We started with two schools .
That &apos;s grown this year to about 10 .
It doesn &apos;t animate them .
Thank you very much .
Jack Horner : Where are the baby dinosaurs ?
None , huh ?
All right .
I &apos;m going to talk about dinosaurs .
Dinosaurs are kind of funny , you know .
I hope you all realize that .
That &apos;s it .
What &apos;s the fascination ?
They &apos;re all gone .
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs .
And there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
Lots of different kinds .
They went out and gathered them up .
And this is an interesting story .
And that happened for all museums .
And this was in the early 1900s .
Look at these dinosaurs .
They &apos;re all big .
Where are all the little ones ? &quot;
And it comes down to a couple of things .
They like to name anything .
Now think about that .
So this was interesting .
So this is where people went astray again .
They put them in foam , little containers .
They &apos;re very well taken care of .
So they don &apos;t normally let you do that .
So that &apos;s what I do .
So it &apos;s real easy to tell them apart .
And so we will evaluate them .
And that &apos;s sort of what I &apos;ve been doing .
they say , &quot; Go away . &quot;
So here are 12 dinosaurs .
And we want to look at these three first .
So these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurs .
Guess where that came from ? Dragon .
And the other one is more primitive than the other .
But it didn &apos;t give them a clue .
Because , well we know why .
Scientists like to name things .
So it is going to get bigger .
It &apos;s inflating very fast .
Okay .
And we know why , right ?
Because everybody wants to have a big one .
So everyone had a big one .
And that &apos;s pretty cool .
And the little one is really spongy .
And the middle size one is really spongy .
And this is a skull that is two meters long .
It &apos;s a big skull .
&quot; And it has holes in its frill . &quot;
So Torosaurus is extinct .
Anatotitan : giant duck .
It &apos;s a giant duck-bill dinosaur .
Here &apos;s another one .
So we look at the bone histology .
And we get rid of Anatotitan .
So we can just keep doing this .
And the last one is T. Rex .
Again , makes you wonder .
But they had a good question .
So we cut into them .
It looks like it could still get bigger .
And of course , Nano has 17 .
And that &apos;s a good number .
That &apos;s a good number to go extinct , I think .
Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs , they memorize them .
Thank you very much .
Leah Buechley : How to &quot; sketch &quot; with electronics
Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper .
A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC .
Sticker templates .
Speed x 4 .
Making a switch .
Music : DJ Shadow .
Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller .
Sketching an interface .
Pretty cool , huh ? We think so .
So thank you very much .
Jared Diamond : Why do societies collapse ?
What about ourselves ?
What about a society today ?
Are there any general conclusions that arise ?
What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree ?
What &apos;s going to be the outcome today ?
And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades .
Morley : &quot; Women of Hope &quot;
Still same is true of Israel today .
And 3,000 years ago , that &apos;s exactly what happens .
He &apos;s 6 foot 9 .
So he says , &quot; All right . &quot;
He says , &quot; I can &apos;t wear this stuff . &quot;
That &apos;s all he &apos;s carrying .
Now why do we call David an underdog ?
In ancient warfare , there are three kinds of warriors .
There &apos;s cavalry , men on horseback and with chariots .
This is an incredibly devastating weapon .
They were incredibly accurate .
Saul has the same expectation .
But David has absolutely no expectation .
He &apos;s not going to fight him that way . Why would he ?
That &apos;s where his strength lies .
There &apos;s a second piece of this that &apos;s important .
It &apos;s also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath .
Goliath is not what he seems to be .
Now that is weird , right ?
He &apos;s not even carrying a sword .
Why does Goliath not react to that ?
Sticks ? David only has one stick .
There have been many articles written .
He had acromegaly .
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant ?
Famous . He had acromegaly .
Because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
Because he can &apos;t see him .
Come to me because I can &apos;t see you .
Thank you .
Bernie Krause : The voice of the natural world
But they do .
The soundscape is made up of three basic sources .
The second of these is the biophony .
This is Lincoln Meadow .
This is an example of a spectrogram .
There were a lot of them .
This is after selective logging .
Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker .
Whether or not we understand it is a different story .
And they do that for two reasons .
Yeah . Well .
Thank you for listening .
Aparna Rao : High-tech art
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prototype .
And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
So this is a very early prototype .
Of course , it got much better after that .
This is a video installation called &quot; The Missing Person . &quot;
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
So this is a work called &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot;
And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
And there &apos;s no wires .
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
Thank you .
Charles Robertson : Africa &apos;s next boom
Africa is booming .
It &apos;s that quick .
And the West is engaging with that .
Politics gets weaker when debt is high .
And it &apos;s not just the public sector which is looking so good .
The private sector as well .
That &apos;s an awful lot of debt .
And this investment is actually Western-led .
Ten percent &apos;s come from India .
And they &apos;re investing in energy .
Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now .
It &apos;s the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia .
And they &apos;re investing in telecoms , shopping malls .
Now , that &apos;s completely changed now .
You look at South Asia , and people are .
A bit dangerous , sometimes .
Nobody else did .
So what &apos;s Africa looking like today ?
This is how I look at Africa .
It &apos;s a bit odd , because I &apos;m an economist .
South Africa is playing a role .
Fragile democracies is the beige color .
Strong democracies are the orange color .
Why does that matter ?
He won by a margin .
So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education .
It &apos;s a positive , virtuous circle .
Three out of 10 . That &apos;s not good .
Every poor country is corrupt .
Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt .
You see the middle class grow .
Now , I don &apos;t want to be an apologist for corruption .
Economists aren &apos;t great at forecasting .
Because the question really is , what happens next ?
No offense .
India is one of those examples .
Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second .
Boom ! India began to explode .
Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years .
&quot; Charlie , why are you so pessimistic ? &quot;
And you know what ?
Actually , I think they &apos;ve got a point .
Because technology does let you help .
My iPod &apos;s full of them .
Buy African products .
Go on holiday and see for yourself the change that &apos;s happening .
Invest .
Thank you very much .
Jimmy Wales : The birth of Wikipedia
So we &apos;ve got over 600,000 articles in English .
So this is where we get to Yochai &apos;s discussion .
People are always asking , &quot; Well , who &apos;s in charge of this ? &quot;
It &apos;s a very unusual and chaotic thing .
And everything is managed by the volunteers .
And that &apos;s essentially our main cost .
The media has covered this somewhat extensively .
It started out with an article in Red Herring .
So how do we do this ?
How do we manage the quality control ?
How does it work ?
So real-time peer review .
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages .
And so there &apos;s nothing in the software that enforces the rules .
The example I &apos;ve got up here is a Votes For Deletion page .
There &apos;s no reason to have a big argument about it .
And it also matters who the people are who are voting .
Like I say , it &apos;s a tight knit community .
So how &apos;s all this governed ?
There &apos;s a certain amount of aristocracy .
It just isn &apos;t appropriate .
Well , they managed to get 18 people to show up .
That &apos;s neo-Nazi math for you .
On the other hand , people said , &quot; But what are we going to do ?
Then I said , &quot; Well fuck it , we &apos;ll just change the rules . &quot;
Thank you .
Ben Saunders : Yeah , hi , Ben Saunders .
And I said , &quot; Well , they don &apos;t all hate it . &quot;
But I think there &apos;s going to be huge impacts .
Andrew McAfee : What will future jobs look like ?
And there &apos;s actually a huge amount of truth here .
We are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place .
This is just a plain statement of the facts .
We are in the middle of an astonishing period .
So this is clearly bad news for Reuther .
But the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
We &apos;re going to call him &quot; Ted . &quot;
He &apos;s at the top of the American middle class .
We &apos;re going to call that guy &quot; Bill . &quot;
Over this time frame , Ted has continued to hold a full-time job . Bill hasn &apos;t .
Over time , Ted &apos;s marriage has stayed quite happy .
Bill &apos;s hasn &apos;t .
So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward .
I witnessed this firsthand .
We have to do better than this .
We cannot keep turning out Bills .
So the green shoots are out there .
We &apos;re facing very tough challenges .
Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient .
He said , &quot; I am a firm believer in the people .
Thank you very much .
David Brooks : The social animal
But they have those social skills .
And he &apos;s going into a diner .
But that reality is expunged from our policy-making process .
It would be a big seller .
And this leads to oddities .
Now I &apos;m a middle-aged guy .
I &apos;m not exactly comfortable with emotions .
It was just sheer terror .
It tells us what to imprint .
The brain is the record of the feelings of a life .
We are now children of the French Enlightenment .
We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties .
Babies come with this ability .
He wagged his tongue at the baby .
The baby wagged her tongue back .
They have trouble relating to other people .
They have epistemological modesty .
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .
They are curious .
Then you could talk about a trait like blending .
It seems so elementary .
But this is the source of innovation .
The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige .
That is what the unconscious mind hungers for .
Thank you .
Barry Schwartz : Our loss of wisdom
But what did he appeal to ?
Invest , invest , invest . &quot;
And he appealed to virtue .
Virtue is an old-fashioned word .
Let me begin with an example .
Not one .
Now , not all janitors are like this , of course .
To serve other people , not to manipulate other people .
At TED , brilliance is rampant .
It &apos;s scary .
Now , I hope that we all know this .
It &apos;s a story about lemonade .
So he brought it back .
And they were ready to let the kid go .
But not so fast .
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no .
How do things like this happen ?
Fair enough .
One tool we reach for is rules .
Better ones , more of them .
The second tool we reach for is incentives .
Better ones , more of them .
What else , after all , is there ?
Regulate , regulate , regulate .
Fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
It &apos;s preposterous on its face .
The lemonade story is one .
Here &apos;s an example from Chicago kindergarten .
We know why these scripts are there .
And they prevent disaster .
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity .
Don &apos;t get me wrong . We need rules !
Now , how about incentives ?
They seem cleverer .
Right ?
Well , not always .
There was going to be a national referendum .
Astonishingly , 50 percent of the citizens said yes .
They knew it was dangerous .
Instead of 50 percent saying yes , 25 percent said yes .
Get smarter incentives .
We see this in medicine .
And we certainly see it in the world of business .
So what can we do ?
What to do instead ?
One : Celebrate moral exemplars .
Well , acknowledge them .
Be proud that you have them .
Celebrate them .
That &apos;s one thing we can do .
Two were particularly inspiring to me .
Why ? Because it was the right thing to do .
His employees are inspired by the effort .
In many ways this is the perfect example .
Because it took the will to do the right thing .
There are ordinary heroes .
One is that we are always teaching .
Someone is always watching .
The camera is always on .
They need to learn to respect themselves .
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates .
They need to learn to respect their teachers .
That &apos;s the principle objective .
Obama appealed to virtue .
And I think he was right .
He also appealed to hope .
Right again .
I think there is reason for hope .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Barry Schwartz : Thank you very much .
There were quite many people infected in the United States .
And , up there , you see Uganda .
Now , what has happened ?
But first , I have a new invention here .
So , ready , steady , go !
They went upwards like this .
And almost the same happens here .
25 years it took .
Now , let me make a fast replay of Botswana .
But focus now is back on prevention .
We have to stop that .
So , why is it so high ? Is it war ?
No , it &apos;s not . Look here .
And this is peaceful Zambia , neighboring country -- 15 percent .
So , is it poverty ?
So , this is the difference within Tanzania .
And , I can &apos;t avoid showing Kenya .
Look here at Kenya .
I &apos;ve split Kenya in its provinces .
Here it goes .
So , what is it then ?
But where are they situated ?
I will swap the bubbles to a map .
HIV exists all over the world .
Brazil has many HIV-infected .
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran .
India has many because they are many .
Southeast Asia , and so on .
It could be concurrency .
It could be some virus types .
And what is concurrency ?
We have serial monogamy .
Vodka , New Year &apos;s Eve -- new partner for the spring .
Vodka , Midsummer &apos;s Eve -- new partner for the fall .
Vodka -- and it goes on like this , you know ?
And you collect a big number of exes .
Probably , it &apos;s a combination of this .
You can get this chart , free .
Thank you very much .
Bob Mankoff : Anatomy of a New Yorker cartoon
That part of the relationship went fine .
Now let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
You couldn &apos;t satisfy this guy .
&quot; Another joke on old white males . Ha ha . The wit .
And one of the things that you realize is it &apos;s an unusual environment .
Here I &apos;m one person talking to you .
Let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
&quot; Discouraging data on the antidepressant . &quot;
Indeed , it is discouraging .
Right ? You thought it was funny .
Generally , about 85 percent of the people liked it .
But look at the individual responses .
&quot; I like animals ! ! ! ! ! &quot; Look how much they like them .
This person rated it a two .
&quot; I don &apos;t like to see animals suffer -- even in cartoons . &quot;
Other people thought it was funny .
Humor is a type of entertainment .
That &apos;s a bad zoo .
But this is a worse one .
Where is the danger going to exist ?
How are you going to manage it ?
Of course , many , many cartoons must be rejected .
Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week .
But they mostly are going to be rejected .
That &apos;s the nature of any creative activity .
Matt Diffee is one of them .
Here &apos;s one of his cartoons .
Drew Dernavich . &quot; Accounting night at the improv . &quot;
And of course , that is not New Yorker humor .
What is New Yorker humor ?
The word &quot; idea drawings , &quot; and that &apos;s the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons .
This is What Lemmings Believe .
No . It &apos;s about us .
And this is my most well-known cartoon .
&quot; No , Thursday &apos;s out . How about never — is never good for you ? &quot;
It &apos;s been reprinted thousands of times , totally ripped off .
In each instance , our expectations are defied .
In each instance , the narrative gets switched .
There &apos;s an incongruity and a contrast .
In &quot; No , Thursday &apos;s out . How about never — is never good for you ? &quot;
He is both being polite and rude .
Basically , that &apos;s the way humor works .
So I &apos;m a humor analyst , you would say .
Now E.B. White said , analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog .
Well , I &apos;m going to kill a few , but there won &apos;t be any genocide .
Bob Mankoff : &quot; Oooh , no .
Ehhh .
Oooh . Hmm . Too funny .
No . Nah . No .
Overdrawn . Underdrawn .
Drawn just right , still not funny enough .
No . No .
For God &apos;s sake no , a thousand times no .
Office worker : Got a ham and swiss on rye ? BM : No .
Office worker : Smoked turkey with bacon ? BM : No .
Office worker : Falafel ? BM : Let me look at it .
Eh , no .
Office worker : Grilled cheese ? BM : No .
Office worker : Green bean salad ? BM : No .
No . No .
That &apos;s sort of an exaggeration of what I do .
&quot; I &apos;m thinking about having a child . &quot;
&quot; Ass-head . Please help . &quot;
I &apos;m going to explain why .
It &apos;s rude . The world really shouldn &apos;t be that way .
Within that context , we feel it &apos;s okay .
Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...
&quot; T-Cell Army : Can the body &apos;s immune response help treat cancer ? &quot; Oh , goodness .
There is no such thing as funny in and of itself .
One way to look at it is this .
When we &apos;re in a playful mood , we want excitement .
We want high arousal . We feel excited then .
You want to be transgressed .
It &apos;s like this , like an amusement park .
Voice : Here we go .
&quot; Too snug ? &quot;
That &apos;s a cartoon about terrorism .
The New Yorker occupies a very different space .
How would The New Yorker attack it ?
Better left undrawn .
The first week we did no cartoons .
It &apos;s not always appropriate every time .
But the next week , this was the first cartoon .
We were going to exist . Here &apos;s another one .
The humor reflects back on us .
It &apos;s called dispositional humor .
Here &apos;s another cartoon .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state . &quot;
Humor does need a target .
That is a deeply profound cartoon .
Different frames of reference .
&quot; You slept with her , didn &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Lassie ! Get help ! ! &quot;
It &apos;s called French Army Knife .
Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling .
Like , this cartoon would puzzle many people .
How many people know what this cartoon means ?
The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk .
This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog .
That could happen . It &apos;s humor within the realm of reality .
Now that &apos;s a little puzzling , right ? It doesn &apos;t quite come together .
It &apos;s sort of a smorgasbord that &apos;s made all interesting .
&quot; It sort of makes you stop and think , doesn &apos;t it . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Robert Full : Learning from the gecko &apos;s tail
These are gecko toes .
And here is its first test .
More recently , this happened .
This the first time someone has actually climbed with it .
How do you know ?
Lynn Verinsky : Because of liability insurance .
So you &apos;re the first human being to officially emulate a gecko .
Lynn Verinsky : Ha ! Wow . And what a privilege that has been .
Here is the actual robot .
And here is what it does .
There it is .
So what they did was they asked us an important question .
They said , &quot; Well , it kind of looks like a tail . &quot;
&quot; Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls ? &quot;
We said , &quot; Well , what do tails do ? &quot;
It can also act as a counterbalance .
So watch this kangaroo .
See that tail ? That &apos;s incredible !
Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot .
And it was unstable without its tail .
But of course , this is a passive tail .
And you can also have active tails .
It can also be used in defense .
Pretty powerful .
So we then went back and looked at the animal .
And we ran it up a surface .
So here is normal speed .
This is incredible .
The engineers had a really good idea .
And this is what we discovered .
But there it is slowed down .
But geckos do it better .
And they do it with their tail .
If we could have the lights on it .
Okay , there it goes .
And show the video .
There it is .
And it works just like it does in the animal .
So we did . And here is what it does .
It does an equilibrium glide . Highly controlled .
So we can maneuver this way .
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin .
It can actually swim through the air .
Stay tuned for that .
And it certainly looks like it .
Watch the animal .
Definitely moving towards the landing target .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
We wondered , &quot; Do they actually glide in nature ? &quot;
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia .
Look at the end to see the animal .
You see it there ? There ? Watch it come down .
Naomi Klein : Addicted to risk
This is the boat we were on , by the way .
Now this shouldn &apos;t come as a surprise to us .
Thus the title &quot; Silent Spring . &quot;
Better to err on the side of caution .
Can we put this off till 2020 , 2030 , 2050 ? &quot;
And you actually don &apos;t have a lot of options .
Don &apos;t feel ashamed .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
Let &apos;s hear from Tony Hayward again .
&quot; The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean .
A new bubble will replace the old one .
The Earth always did have limits .
They were just beyond our sights .
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad .
There are still no limits .
There will always be another frontier .
So stop worrying and keep shopping .
This assessment , unfortunately , is far too optimistic .
And most controversially , it means the tar sands .
The oil is not liquid .
That &apos;s a person down there by the wheel .
It &apos;s not even mining .
It is terrestrial skinning .
But , of course , our secular religion is technology .
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot .
An escape hatch has been reached .
A new frontier has been found .
We badly need some new stories .
That this is our only home .
There is no escape hatch .
Thank you .
Christoph Adami : Finding life we can &apos;t imagine
So I have a strange career .
No , no , I wasn &apos;t 14 years old .
And I was actually a rocket scientist .
But it was an exciting experience .
Yet , I had a very good answer .
I said , &quot; I have no idea . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Really ?
Because isn &apos;t that easy ?
I mean , we have life .
But here &apos;s something . &quot;
And then you see something like that .
Anyone know ?
Except that nowadays , it &apos;s heavily disputed .
So can life be defined ?
Well how would you go about it ?
And then you might get something .
And then you might come up with something like this .
Why ? Because these things don &apos;t evolve by themselves .
In fact , they have hackers writing them .
And this was Steen Rasmussen .
But what is this system like ?
There &apos;s about 10,000 programs sitting here .
And all different strains are colored in different colors .
And this process goes on and on and on .
Can we measure this type of life ?
As long as I know that there &apos;s some sort of alphabet .
They all have their own type of frequency distribution , but it &apos;s robust .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it writes about politics or about science .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a poem or whether it &apos;s a mathematical text .
It &apos;s a robust signature , and it &apos;s very stable .
And here &apos;s the result .
So this also turns out to be extremely robust .
And it is detectable not just in amino acids .
They have about 28 of these instructions .
Each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency .
In this case , the frequency is lower .
So let &apos;s see what that looks like .
Too hot , too hot .
And of course , it reaches the viability threshold .
You hit the viability threshold .
The distribution changes to &quot; alive ! &quot;
And then that signature is lost .
What do we learn from that ?
And thank you very much .
Jonas Gahr Støre : In defense of dialogue
We loosely call them &quot; groups . &quot;
And we struggle with how to deal with them .
They need political solutions .
It was black or white .
Now I &apos;m not naive .
And there are times you should walk .
And sometimes military intervention is necessary .
Let us turn to Afghanistan .
The situation , to be honest , is very serious .
We just have to persevere . &quot;
Everybody seems to agree with that .
Now everybody agrees .
Because we didn &apos;t talk .
We didn &apos;t grasp what was going on .
And you can always walk .
It &apos;s hard , but it is necessary .
Let me go one step further .
This is Tahrir Square .
There &apos;s a revolution going on .
It will last for a long , long time .
That &apos;s not the point .
Social groups are taking to the streets .
Should we talk to Hamas ?
I think that is wrong .
Because they may turn out to be a majority .
How will we ever be interlocutors ?
Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion .
There &apos;s a big array of the ways of dealing with this .
It &apos;s their right to fight . &quot;
We have to connect with these profound changes .
And what is dialogue really about ?
Sometimes you have to .
We are seeing some new signs .
The good thing is that we are not powerless .
Thank you for your attention .
And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
So a high I.Q.
Thank you .
Angella Ahn : Thank you .
Thank you so much .
What an exciting and inspiring event .
We want to play you one more selection .
It was more atonal and twelve-tone .
So this is &quot; Oblivion &quot; by Astor Piazzolla .
Thank you .
Arthur Benjamin : The magic of Fibonacci numbers
So why do we learn mathematics ?
That &apos;s great .
Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
Let &apos;s look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers .
That &apos;s how they &apos;re created .
But check this out .
In fact , here &apos;s another one .
Let &apos;s see what we get there .
So one plus one plus four is six .
Add nine to that , we get 15 .
Add 25 , we get 40 .
Add 64 , we get 104 .
Now look at those numbers .
Fibonacci ! Of course .
Let &apos;s look at that last equation .
Together , they form a one-by-two rectangle .
Just as we created it .
That &apos;s the area .
So the area is also eight times 13 .
Now check this out .
Thank you very much .
Don Tapscott : Four principles for the open world
Why is this happening ?
The technology revolution is opening the world .
The Internet of today is a platform for computation .
Collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis .
Now a new generation is opening up the world as well .
I call them the Net Generation .
It &apos;s like the air .
I &apos;m a digital immigrant .
I had to learn the language .
The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well .
I mean , think about Wall Street .
Now , what is openness ?
The first is collaboration .
His name is Rob McEwen .
I &apos;ve read some of your books . &quot;
I said , &quot; Great . What do you do ? &quot;
And he tells me this amazing story .
So he does a &quot; radical &quot; thing .
He viewed talent differently .
He wondered , who are their peers ?
They came from computer scientists , engineers .
It &apos;s not about hooking up online .
This is a new means of production in the making .
Openness is about collaboration .
Now secondly , openness is about transparency .
You say you have good products .
They &apos;d better be good .
But you also need to have values .
So this is good . It &apos;s not bad .
Sunlight is the best disinfectant .
Now this is different than transparency .
Transparency is about the communication of information .
Sharing is about giving up assets , intellectual property .
And there are all kinds of famous stories about this .
So we need to think differently about intellectual property .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble .
Do you know about this ?
We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research .
And I &apos;m not talking about the motherhood sense here .
The open world is bringing freedom .
Now , take the Arab Spring .
You know , one word : Tunisia .
It was a tool of self-defense .
So this is a time of great change .
Now , it &apos;s not without its problems .
But that doesn &apos;t matter , because this is moving forward .
The toothpaste is out of the tube .
People didn &apos;t know about things .
There was no concept of progress .
So we saw the Protestant Reformation .
But it came with a cost .
The printing press gave us access to the written word .
The Internet enables each of us to be a producer .
The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge .
Now , this thing has a function .
It protects the birds .
This is a huge collaboration .
Could we start to share our intelligence ?
Let &apos;s do this . Thank you .
First is physiological .
It &apos;s not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it .
This is surf .
It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute .
The second way in which sound affects you is psychological .
Music is not the only kind of sound , however , which affects your emotions .
Natural sound can do that too .
The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively .
Try and listen to the other one .
Put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be .
The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally .
And that &apos;s not the only thing that bad sound damages .
At last we &apos;ve got some science we can apply .
And we &apos;re in the business of designing soundscapes .
I &apos;ll give you two examples .
Most of you recognize that immediately .
The younger , maybe not .
Now , those are one-second samples of music .
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound .
1.8 billion times a day , that tune is played .
And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing .
That increases impact by over 1,100 percent .
That &apos;s an order of magnitude , up or down .
This is important .
Secondly , make it appropriate to the situation .
Don &apos;t just bombard them with stuff .
And , finally , test and test it again .
Sound is complex . There are many countervailing influences .
Thank you for lending me your ears today .
Christopher McDougall : Are we born to run ?
That &apos;s her competition .
The gun goes off , and she &apos;s not even an underdog .
She &apos;s under the underdogs .
Now this is when something really bizarre happens .
Derartu Tulu ruins the script .
So Paula Radcliffe , unfortunately , does it .
But then she falls back again .
Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things .
The Tarahumara had a different strategy .
They are free from all of these modern ailments .
So what &apos;s the connection ?
They &apos;re trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries .
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .
We &apos;re not fast .
For some reason you guys are just really slow .
Her uterus would be torn .
Yes . You would have torn reproductive organs .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
So you have these three mysteries .
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .
We &apos;re really good at being sweaty and smelly .
That &apos;s all we could do .
You need a pack to pull together .
Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack .
They can &apos;t be 10 miles behind .
They need to be part of the pack .
The pack stays together .
But maybe it &apos;s something different .
We try to cash in on it .
I didn &apos;t do yoga . I &apos;m not ready . &quot;
Humans ran and ran all the time .
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes .
So what &apos;s the benefit ? So what ?
So you burn off the Haagen-Dazs from the night before ?
But maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
I &apos;ve experienced it personally myself .
So hopefully it &apos;s something we can all benefit from .
Jessa Gamble : Our natural sleep cycle
Let &apos;s start with day and night .
So , we have this ability as well .
And in humans , we call it the &quot; body clock . &quot;
So , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
They go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
So , cut to the modern day .
Thank you .
Maajid Nawaz : A global culture to fight extremism
In medieval societies there were defined allegiances .
An identity was defined primarily by religion .
In the age of globalization , we moved on .
And that &apos;s something which I &apos;d like to elaborate on .
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear .
We felt that they were out of date .
Eventually I was detected , of course , in Egypt .
In certain countries , mosque minarets are being banned .
In others , headscarves are being banned .
Now that never would have been possible before .
Where does that leave democracy aspirants ?
Well I believe they &apos;re getting left far behind .
So why are they succeeding ?
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind ?
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this .
And that &apos;s the power of social movements .
So that begs the next question .
And I believe that &apos;s for four reasons .
I believe , number one , it &apos;s complacency .
Let &apos;s bring the military back again . &quot;
Is it just about grievances ?
Is it just about a lack of education ?
Now to conclude , how does that happen ?
Well , Egypt is a good starting point .
We need to move one step beyond that now .
And it &apos;s with that thought that I &apos;ll end .
And my time is up , and thank you for your time .
Susan Lim : Transplant cells , not organs
in the following year .
The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation .
I was also pregnant at the time .
I witnessed the technical difficulty .
Fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells .
What lies ahead ?
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide .
1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly .
4.8 million suffer cardiac failure .
Powerful new technologies always present enigmas .
Each one has his story .
Thank you .
Arvind Gupta : Turning trash into toys for learning
I &apos;ve been making toys for the last 30 years .
The early &apos; 70s , I was in college .
It was a very revolutionary time .
In India , we had the Naxalite movement , the &#91; unclear &#93; movement .
The National Movement of India was testimony to that .
Many people were inspired by this .
Live with them ; love them .
Start from what they know . Build on what they have . &quot;
This was kind of the defining slogan .
Well I took one year .
And it was a turning point .
So I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to spend a year over here . &quot;
This is called a cycle valve tube .
It &apos;s like its own little coupling .
And they have some wonderful properties .
You give it a push , this becomes a parallelogram .
But this is very shaky .
Push it and it becomes house shaped .
This square might look very square and prim .
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus .
It becomes kite-shaped .
Why use triangles ?
Because triangles are the only rigid structures .
Because if they put tiles on top , it &apos;s just going to crash .
They always make a triangular roof .
Now this is people science .
So you make all these 3D shapes .
You make a tetrahedron like this .
Put this on top .
You just need a ton .
You can play around with it .
This makes an igloo .
Now this is in 1978 .
I was a 24-year-old young engineer .
I see hope . I see happiness in their faces .
Now this , we make lots and lots of pumps .
You put a little sticky tape .
This is one-way traffic .
Well we make lots and lots of pumps .
And this is the pump .
It &apos;s like a centrifuge .
Right .
There are four pictures .
But this is great fun for children .
They all study about the food chain .
The insects are eaten by the frogs ; the frogs are eaten by the snakes ; the snakes are eaten by the eagles .
In three minutes , you just fold this up .
And you put a little fan here .
There have been six major research papers on this .
There &apos;s some grooves over here , you can see .
Six major research papers on this .
He wrote a paper on this .
This is a straw .
This is a kind of a blowing straw .
I just put this inside this .
What we do is make a very simple electric motor .
Now this is the simplest motor on Earth .
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this .
This is a permanent magnet .
We made 30,000 .
When teachers make it , children make it .
You can see a gleam in their eye .
They get a thrill of what science is all about .
Over 100,000 children learn science this way .
And we &apos;re just trying to see possibilities .
You put this in your mouth , and you blow .
And something very , very nice happens .
This is a touching slate meant for blind children .
And this is wool over here .
If I crank the handle , all the wool goes inside .
And what a blind child can do is to just draw this .
Wool sticks on Velcro .
And this has come as a great boon to them .
But this has come as a great boon for them .
This is very , very simple .
These are two magnets .
Small pulley and two strong magnets .
There will be a spinning magnetic field .
So this is a small crank generator .
And they &apos;d be absolutely joyous playing with this .
This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar .
It &apos;s a great cricket cap .
And this is -- you can see -- this is a flapping bird .
Well in the end , I &apos;ll just end with a story .
This is called &quot; The Captain &apos;s Hat Story . &quot;
It goes very slowly .
And the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia .
It &apos;s been catapulted to international glory .
So that &apos;s a ship .
They were singing and dancing .
And there &apos;s a third one over here .
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down .
Thank you so much .
That &apos;s older than my dad .
That &apos;s next to impossible .
They &apos;re kind of like the superheroes of material science .
So that &apos;s why I chose to use paper .
My mom wouldn &apos;t really like that .
So instead , I decided to go for a lab .
You &apos;re going to save us all ! &quot;
However , there was a silver lining .
So I went in that direction .
How unlikely is that ? I mean , pshhh .
But it wouldn &apos;t stop there .
It &apos;s just your ideas that count .
You could be changing the world .
Thank you .
Shereen El Feki : Pop culture in the Arab world
Yes . That &apos;s right . This is Barbie .
And should they ever come in contact ...
I want to show you two examples .
The first is 4Shbab .
: Video clips from across the globe .
The USA .
And they look something like this .
In the world of 4Shbab , it &apos;s not about bump and grind .
But it &apos;s not about fire and brimstone either .
And it &apos;s called &quot; The 99 . &quot;
Now , these are the world &apos;s first Islamic superheroes .
So , for example , there is the character of Noora .
It &apos;s now a theme park .
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash .
Adam Grosser : A mobile fridge for vaccines
This is a problem .
Time for some thermodynamics .
And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator .
It &apos;s one of those things that stuck in my head .
There &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
But it was kind of an interesting thought .
So , this is the way it works .
You put it on a cooking fire .
Weighs about eight pounds , and this is the way it works .
Thank you .
David Cameron : The next age of government
And someone asked , &quot; Why ? &quot;
We have vast budget deficits .
So , starting with the political philosophy .
Of course we don &apos;t .
Local power , central power , now , people power .
You could just about go to war and that was about it .
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age .
And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully . There we are .
Suddenly , you have the big , strong , central state .
It was able -- but only it was able -- to organize health care , education , policing , justice .
It had sucked all that power up from the localities .
It was able to do that itself .
So , how could this happen ?
And the third of these big changes : accountability .
This , I think , is a huge change .
It is a crime map . This is a crime map from Chicago .
We &apos;re working with some of these people .
How do you do it ?
Look at what this does . This is a simple piece of behavioral economics .
Other examples are recycling .
We all know we need to recycle more .
How do we make it happen ?
Thank you .
Charles Hazlewood : Trusting the ensemble
My job depends upon it .
That &apos;s all I have at the point of sale .
It &apos;s silent gesture .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Scottish Ensemble .
You overcompensate .
You end up like some kind of rabid windmill .
Bugger me , they wouldn &apos;t give it to me .
Let &apos;s be under no illusions .
Simply through singing .
One of them was &quot; Carmen . &quot;
South Africans just make music really freely .
They don &apos;t read music .
They trust their ears .
Why is this ?
Did you know that TED is a tune ?
Now hang on a minute .
T , see it &apos;s the same as F in music .
So T is F.
Have a listen .
Do you hear it ?
If you &apos;ll pardon the expression .
Oh my goodness me , there it was loud and clear , surely .
I think we need to sing for our tea .
Will you have a go for me ?
Audience : T , E , D.
Shall we try that one again ?
T , E , D.
Audience : T , E , D.
CH : Once more with vim .
Now we &apos;re going to put that in the context of the music .
You won &apos;t make the key otherwise .
Well done , ladies and gentlemen .
It &apos;s called Paraorchestra .
It was a really extraordinary moment .
No one &apos;s listening . No one &apos;s trusting .
No one &apos;s responding to each other .
Nicholas : : My name &apos;s Nicholas McCarthy .
And I was born without my left hand -- right hand .
Can I do that one again ?
I become alive .
It &apos;s removed some of my paralysis .
Paraorchestra is the name of that project .
You can imagine , the musicians were disconsolate .
Haydn remonstrated with the prince , but to no avail .
Courtney Martin : This isn &apos;t her mother &apos;s feminism
Thank you . Thank you for hip-hop -- and Anita Hill .
My parents were radicals -- who became , well , grown-ups .
Feminism was the water I grew up in .
You can see how this had an influence .
He &apos;s actually here today .
They were the co-authors of a book called &quot; Manifesta . &quot;
Fishnet stockings .
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them .
I thought they were really hot .
My mom says , &quot; patriarchy . &quot;
I say , &quot; intersectionality . &quot;
Pay equity ? Yes . Absolutely a feminist issue .
But for me , so is immigration .
Thank you .
My mom says , &quot; Protest march . &quot;
I say , &quot; Online organizing . &quot;
But we also have a straightforward political impact .
My mom says , &quot; Gloria Steinem . &quot;
We don &apos;t want one hero .
We don &apos;t want one icon .
We don &apos;t want one face .
Thank you .
These are three words many of us were raised with .
It &apos;s enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .
I was fired up ; I was ready to make a difference .
Which brings me to my third paradox .
You may have guessed by now , I did not light myself on fire .
I wrote the book I needed to read .
Instead , what she really wanted to do was make films .
But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force .
And at the end of the day , what could possibly be more important than that ?
Cornel West says , &quot; Of course it &apos;s a failure .
But how good a failure is it ? &quot;
This isn &apos;t to say we give up our wildest , biggest dreams .
It &apos;s to say we operate on two levels .
It &apos;s about embracing the paradox .
It &apos;s about acting in the face of overwhelm .
And it &apos;s about loving people really well .
Thank you .
Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy : Inside a school for suicide bombers
The Taliban now run their own schools .
Hazrat Ali is from a poor farming family in Swat .
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack .
H If God gives me strength .
Effectively , this is the brainwashing process that has begun .
This boy is called Zenola .
He blew himself up , killing six .
This boy is called Sadik .
He killed 22 .
This boy is called Messoud .
He killed 28 .
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack ?
Boy : I would love to .
But only if I get permission from my dad .
SOC : What blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack ?
Then God will look at my intention .
Thank you .
Jennifer Granholm : A clean energy proposal -- race to the top !
And he said , &quot; 3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville . &quot;
So it is a one-company town .
And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico .
So I said , &quot; Forget that . I &apos;m the new Governor .
In fact , they did implode the factory .
My father worked at this factory , &quot; he said .
&quot; My grandfather worked at this factory .
All I know is how to make refrigerators . &quot;
Who is ever going to hire me ? &quot;
We got a problem , folks .
So it got me thinking , what is it ?
Because Republican and Democratic governors love to cut ribbons .
We want to bring jobs . I &apos;m just saying .
Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table ?
They can &apos;t agree to anything . &quot;
Or , you renegades , we could go around Congress .
Go around Congress .
And we can get in the game or not .
Thank you all so much .
Alex Steffen : The route to a sustainable future
So just bear with me . We &apos;ll go real fast , you know ?
Fill in the blanks .
So , you know , sustainability , small planet .
And , you know , built the society that we now live in .
We &apos;re using up about five planets .
Clearly we don &apos;t have 10 planets .
And people simply do not have enough to survive .
And there &apos;s more and more people on the way . Right ?
A third of the people on this planet are kids .
They &apos;ve been exposed to this idea of our society , of our prosperity .
And they may not want to live exactly like us .
I don &apos;t need to go into that .
We don &apos;t know how to do this yet .
So what &apos;s Worldchanging ?
Talk about the kinds of things we &apos;re scoping out .
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook .
And given that I have 13 minutes to do this , this is going to go kind of quick .
So , first of all , what are we looking for ? Bright Green city .
You leave aside what is natural to be natural .
This is in Portland . That is an actual development .
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity .
They &apos;ve bounded the city with a line .
Nature , city . Nothing changes .
You can start to know where things are .
When you share them , you end up using less .
But , you know , there may even be a simpler approach .
We could just re-label things .
How we build things can change as well .
This is a bio-morphic building .
It takes its inspiration in form from life .
We &apos;re starting to cover this more and more .
So this , for example , is hydrogen-generating algae .
It &apos;s every seven days .
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
Well , the first thing we need is , we need leapfrogging .
One place we &apos;re all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones . Right ?
So I rather like this picture here .
So what we have , increasingly , is cell phones just permeating out through society .
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo .
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back .
So it &apos;s not , you know , Bollywood isn &apos;t just answering Hollywood . Right ?
You know , Brazilian music scene isn &apos;t just answering the major labels .
These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda .
Another world is possible .
We tweak that a lot .
How many people knew of Lula before today ?
OK , so , much , much better than the average crowd , I can tell you that .
I would keep your eye on this fellow .
And , you know , we don &apos;t hear those stories enough .
You get , for example , green power spread throughout the world .
You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad , India .
It &apos;s the greenest building in the world .
You get access to distance medicine .
Here &apos;s a way of transporting water .
I mean , that &apos;s a great design .
This is a fabulous invention , LifeStraw .
So , you know , people who are in desperate straits can get this .
Seriously -- give that one a hand , it &apos;s pretty great .
How do we help people like that ?
New models for pedagogy for the displaced .
And we have new tools .
This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere .
Does anyone know what this is ?
Audience : It detects landmines .
Alex Steffen : Exactly , this is a landmine-detecting flower .
Yeah , so seeds that could save your life . You know ?
You know , that it &apos;s not just enough to survive .
And I think that we will .
I hope that that turns out to be true .
Thank you very much .
Rives : A story of mixed emoticons
This means , &quot; I &apos;m smiling . &quot;
So does that .
This means &quot; mouse . &quot;
&quot; Cat . &quot;
Here we have a story .
Here &apos;s where it happens .
These are when .
She wears it every day .
Look at her posture ; it &apos;s remarkable .
That &apos;s because she dances .
And he could say , &quot; Oh my God ! &quot;
or &quot; I heart you ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m laughing out loud . &quot;
&quot; I want to give you a hug . &quot;
But he comes up with that , you know .
Put a crab inside it .
Add some water .
Seven different salts .
And the girl goes , &quot; Wha &apos; ? &quot;
So , the guy replies , &quot; Yeah , I know , I know .
At least , that &apos;s how it seems .
But I &apos;m still suggesting you and I should meet .
First , soon , and then a lot .
Hell , ponytail alone .
I got a pencil you can borrow .
You can put it in your phone . &quot;
But the girl does not budge , does not smile , does not frown .
She just says , &quot; No thank you . &quot;
You know ?
&#91; &quot; i don &apos;t need 2 write it down . &quot; &#93;
Pamela Meyer : How to spot a liar
Also , the person to your left is a liar .
We &apos;re all liars .
I can &apos;t even get a coffee date at Starbucks .
My husband &apos;s like , &quot; Honey , deception ?
Your eyebrow twitched . You flared your nostril .
Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie .
Truth number one about lying : Lying &apos;s a cooperative act .
Now not all lies are harmful .
We say , &quot; Nice song . &quot;
&quot; Honey , you don &apos;t look fat in that , no . &quot;
So sorry . &quot;
But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception .
And that can have dramatic costs for us .
That &apos;s seven percent of revenues .
Deception can cost billions .
Think Enron , Madoff , the mortgage crisis .
Deception is actually serious business .
He said , &quot; Look , I &apos;ve got one rule . &quot;
And that &apos;s the crux of it .
And we all kind of hate to admit it .
We can &apos;t believe how prevalent lying is .
We &apos;re essentially against lying .
But if you look more closely , the plot actually thickens .
We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers .
Extroverts lie more than introverts .
Women lie more to protect other people .
Now you may think that &apos;s bad .
Lying &apos;s complex .
We &apos;re deeply ambivalent about the truth .
That &apos;s truth number two about lying .
It &apos;s as old as breathing .
Think Dante , Shakespeare , the Bible , News of the World .
Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
Now you might remember Koko .
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language .
Here &apos;s Koko with her kitten .
It &apos;s her cute little , fluffy pet kitten .
It &apos;s starts really , really early .
How early ?
One-year-olds learn concealment .
Two-year-olds bluff .
Five-year-olds lie outright .
They manipulate via flattery .
Nine-year-olds , masters of the cover up .
It &apos;s been very confusing for a long time now .
What do you do ?
Trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time .
The rest of us , we &apos;re only 54 percent accurate .
Why is it so easy to learn ?
We &apos;re going to start with speech .
Bill Clinton : I want you to listen to me .
I &apos;m going to say this again .
And these allegations are false .
Thank you .
Freud had it right .
We all chatter with our fingertips .
You &apos;ve really got to just throw your assumptions out the door .
Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit .
You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks .
Now we &apos;re going to look at the hot spots .
An honest person is going to be cooperative .
They &apos;re going to show they &apos;re on your side .
They &apos;re going to be enthusiastic .
They &apos;re going to be willing to brainstorm , name suspects , provide details .
We say &quot; yes , &quot; we shake our heads &quot; no . &quot;
John Edwards : I &apos;d be happy to participate in one .
So I know it &apos;s not possible .
But I &apos;m happy to participate in one .
Murderers are known to leak sadness .
It &apos;s still somewhat of a healthy relationship .
It &apos;s associated with moral superiority .
Here &apos;s what it looks like .
It &apos;s marked by one lip corner pulled up and in .
It &apos;s the only asymmetrical expression .
Science has surfaced many , many more indicators .
They &apos;ll alter their vocal tone , often making their vocal tone much lower .
Now here &apos;s the deal .
These behaviors are just behaviors .
They &apos;re not proof of deception .
They &apos;re red flags .
We &apos;re human beings .
We make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long .
They don &apos;t mean anything in and of themselves .
Don &apos;t be too aggressive , it doesn &apos;t work .
That bothers me the most .
Liespotters rely on human tools .
Our world is lit up 24 hours a day .
It &apos;s a much more noisy world .
And that &apos;s the truth . Thank you .
Apollo Robbins : The art of misdirection
Great . Double-check .
Make sure you still have them on you .
I was doing some shopping beforehand .
Close your eyes .
Now , you &apos;ve been watching me for about 30 seconds .
With your eyes closed , what am I wearing ?
Make your best guess .
Now open your eyes .
By a show of hands , were you right ?
For me , I like to call him Frank .
So Frank is sitting at a desk .
What just happened ? Do you have a wallet ?
Just hold still where you are .
You did a wonderful job onstage .
Oh , you &apos;re married . You follow directions well .
That &apos;s nice to meet you , sir .
Hi , sir , how are you ?
Come on up this way , Joe .
Give Joe a round of applause .
Come on up Joe . Let &apos;s play a game .
Pardon me .
Thank you very much . I appreciate that .
Come on up to the stage , Joe . Let &apos;s play a little game now .
AR : Money . All right , let &apos;s try that .
Hold out your hand for me . Watch it kind of closely .
I &apos;m not ready for that kind of commitment .
It was a big miscommunication .
Joe : Very . AR : Good .
Open your hand . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ll cheat if you give me a chance .
Grab my wrist , but squeeze , squeeze firm .
Did you see it go ?
Go ahead and take it off .
Now , let &apos;s try that again .
It &apos;s back on your shoulder .
Do you remember what it was ?
Joe : Money .
Put your other hand on top for me , would you ?
It &apos;s amazingly obvious now , isn &apos;t it ?
Joe : That &apos;s pretty good . That &apos;s pretty good . AR : Oh , thanks .
It &apos;s not back on your shoulder .
Did you see it go ?
That &apos;s great . I need help with this one .
Step over this way for me .
Can I feel the outside of your pocket for a moment ?
Joe : Yeah . I &apos;m saving it for later .
Hopefully it matches his taste .
Joe , thank you very much .
What am I wearing ?
Attention is a powerful thing .
Thank you .
Daniel Goldstein : The battle between your present and future self
All right , so tie me to the mast . &quot;
I want to hear that song . Untie me . &quot;
And the first mate hesitates .
He throws the first mate to the ground .
Hilarity ensues .
There is first , the present self .
This is like Odysseus when he &apos;s hearing the song .
So why do we need commitment devices ?
It &apos;s physically possible to lose weight .
It &apos;s physically possible to exercise more .
But resisting temptation is hard .
It &apos;s in control . It &apos;s in power right now .
And the future self is not even around .
It &apos;s off in the future . It &apos;s weak .
It doesn &apos;t even have a lawyer present .
There &apos;s nobody to stick up for the future self .
Now I &apos;m a big fan of commitment devices actually .
Such it is with commitment devices .
The more you exercise it , the stronger it gets .
And this is a timely issue .
I &apos;m talking about the topic of saving .
The present self does not want to save at all .
It wants to consume .
So this is a timely problem .
So what can we do about this ?
On the one hand , it sounds ridiculous .
Of course , we know that we &apos;re going to get old .
The first is called the distribution builder .
Now you can try to move your outcomes around .
So this is one of our experiments .
Other conditions show people the future self .
So for instance , here is somebody using the tool .
The older face is miserable .
And slowly , slowly we &apos;re bringing it up to a moderate savings rate .
And then it &apos;s a high savings rate .
The younger face is getting unhappy .
The older face is quite pleased with the decision .
And I &apos;ll close it there .
Thank you .
In my mother &apos;s day , she didn &apos;t go to college .
Not a lot of women did .
The &apos; 20s and the &apos; 60s also come to mind .
And now look at this second set of slides .
Women , a majority of the workplace .
But in fact , they found something very surprising .
Now what does that mean ?
This has been going on for 40 years now .
There we go .
So what &apos;s that about ?
But of course , it &apos;s not about that .
But that really isn &apos;t true anymore .
You would be issuing orders from above .
You would be very hierarchical .
And those are all things that women do very well .
And here the story is fairly simple .
Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men .
Why ? This is a real mystery .
Well it turns out that they &apos;re just very uncomfortable doing that .
Noa : The girls are obviously smarter .
I mean they have much larger vocabulary .
They learn much faster .
They are more controlled .
Hanna Rosin : And why is that ?
HR : So there you go .
And this was kind of a shocker to me .
So who were they ?
And this was very disheartening for them .
&quot; That &apos;s your salary .
&quot; Who &apos;s the damn man ?
She &apos;s the man now . &quot;
And that really sent a shudder through the room .
It &apos;s happening all over the world .
And here &apos;s my favorite example , which is in South Korea .
And now look at the chart .
That &apos;s from 1985 to 2003 .
How much do you prefer a first-born son ?
And they come up in lots of different forms .
So we have the perpetual adolescent .
We have the charmless misanthrope .
You &apos;ve got Lady Gaga .
You &apos;ve got our new James Bond , who &apos;s Angelina Jolie .
And it &apos;s not just for the young , right ?
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days .
Now I &apos;ve never really liked this term .
And also , &quot; shattering the glass ceiling &quot; is a terrible phrase .
You can bring your husband along .
Thanks very much .
This is why wars get fought .
Now , I don &apos;t romanticize evolutionary time .
But there are two in particular that fascinate me .
The first one is the mass restoration of ecosystems .
It sounds strange , but just follow me for a while .
And as soon as that happened , the birds started moving in .
But here &apos;s where it gets really interesting .
They began to meander less .
There was less erosion . The channels narrowed .
But the opposite happened .
Why would that possibly have happened ?
What megafauna , you say ?
They are elephant-adapted .
It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me .
All the young people , actually , from the city .
They wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
But the young people all came .
It just becomes intolerable .
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way .
What do they want from me ? Like , who &apos;s that ?
Who is it who &apos;s going to get enough attention from the world ?
Who &apos;s going to get enough out of the world ?
How awful ! I &apos;m so miserable on my own . My head is aching .
I need a hundred billion . &quot; So I &apos;m like that .
It would be terrible .
But apparently , this is a strange paradox of life .
And we feel ourselves differently . It &apos;s totally strange .
It &apos;s totally strange .
And then it &apos;s never good enough .
They didn &apos;t help at all .
And so then he looks at me .
And yet he &apos;s very jolly . He &apos;s extremely jolly .
It &apos;s really lovely .
The human being is almost out of time .
Now , Jim &apos;s brain is memorizing the almanac .
And he would have tremendous fun doing that .
So then you decide , &quot; Well , I &apos;m sick of myself .
It is Nirvana .
Thank you .
Claron McFadden : Singing the primal mystery
Folks , you &apos;ve just met Claron McFadden .
Please welcome Claron McFadden .
Claron McFadden : The human voice : mysterious , spontaneous , primal .
And the breath , the breath is the captain of that vessel .
A few years ago , I did a meditation retreat in Thailand .
I can &apos;t make noise .
She said , &quot; Please , sing for me . &quot;
Extremely profound experience .
It &apos;s called &quot; Aria . &quot;
No notes , no flats , no sharps .
And there &apos;s different text .
So within this structure one is free .
So I would like to share this piece with you .
It &apos;s &quot; Aria &quot; of John Cage .
Andrea Ghez : The hunt for a supermassive black hole
So , what is a black hole ?
And I &apos;m going to only talk about the mass .
So , this is a little tricky .
So why is it so important ?
At that point , what &apos;s going to happen ?
At that point gravity wins .
Gravity wins over all other known forces .
And then it &apos;s a black hole .
And it turns out that it &apos;s actually pretty simple to figure out .
It depends only on the mass of the object .
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii .
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii .
So , now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is .
I only need two things .
And your job today is to be skeptical .
There are big ones . There are little ones .
So , we see the galaxy because of the star light .
Now , there are a few relatively exotic galaxies .
And we call them active galactic nuclei .
It &apos;s way more energetic .
There are also jets emanating out from the center .
But it &apos;s a kind of indirect argument .
And what we see is a line of stars .
Which is the job that I have to show you today .
It &apos;s the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .
And that is because of the atmosphere .
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
So , I want to see how these things have moved .
Absolutely my favorite star in the world .
And that &apos;s because it goes around in only 15 years .
That &apos;s kind of profound , in a way .
You can see a lot of stars .
Now , truth in advertising . Right ?
And the truth is , I &apos;m not quite there .
And that &apos;s the fun .
So , let me give you the two examples .
And it &apos;s a very fragile entity .
And what does the big black hole do ?
It strips that gas cloud apart .
So , you shouldn &apos;t see young stars .
So , what do we see ?
The old ones are red .
So , you can already see the surprise .
There is a dearth of old stars .
So , this is the fun part .
So , we want to build a 30 meter telescope .
Thanks very much .
Ryan Lobo : Photographing the hidden story
In 2007 , I traveled to three war zones .
I traveled to Iraq , Afghanistan and Liberia .
I would feel very isolated during these discussions .
Photography transcended culture , including my own .
Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist .
And he &apos;s on a mission .
He forgives the General in this image .
I was intensely moved during all this .
And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively .
And yes , all of those people killed were male .
They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months .
Something amazing happened during this shoot .
Now , hundreds of homes were destroyed .
Where does such rage come from ?
They lack even the most basic amenities .
In India we often love to complain about our government bodies .
And that &apos;s the power of storytelling .
Lucianne Walkowicz : Finding planets around other stars
Can you see it ?
There we go .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s shown here in visible light .
They also cause the light from the star to vary .
However , these are just the tip of the iceberg .
Thank you .
Diébédo Francis Kéré : How to build with clay ... and community
I am a native of Burkina Faso .
I am an example of that .
But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write .
Today , not so much has changed .
There is still no electricity in my village .
But I was lucky .
I had a scholarship .
I could go to Germany to study .
But what to do with this privilege ?
Oh yes , I started to make drawings and asked for money .
Fundraising was not an easy task .
So I had to convince everybody .
And the women , the men , everybody from the village , was part of this building process .
I was allowed to use even traditional techniques .
And then the polishers come .
It &apos;s not photoshopped .
This is the school , built with the community .
And the kids , they love it .
The first one is the school extension , of course .
I started to build a prototype like that .
The innovation was to build a clay vault .
The community is looking . It still works .
So we can build .
And we kept building , and that is the result .
The kids are happy , and they love it .
The community is very proud . We made it .
The next project is the library in Gando .
Something we have in Gando are clay pots .
We wanted to use them to create openings .
Very simple .
I would like to share with you this .
How do you cast mud ?
And sometimes I can leave .
They will do it themselves .
Another factor in Gando is rain .
Don &apos;t confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude .
But for us , the rain is good .
We just wait for the rain to go .
We take the sand , we mix it with clay , and we keep building .
That is it .
There &apos;s a new quality in this work .
Yes , you know it .
I have won a lot of awards through this work .
For sure , it has opened opportunities .
I have become myself known .
Merci beaucoup .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Joachim de Posada : Don &apos;t eat the marshmallow !
Exact equivalent .
So what happened when the professor left the room ?
As soon as the door closed ...
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
Couldn &apos;t do it . Could not wait .
Would look at it .
Put it back .
They would walk around . They would play with their skirts and pants .
Self-discipline : the most important factor for success .
What did they find ?
They had good grades . They were doing wonderful .
They were happy . They had their plans .
They had good relationships with the teachers , students .
They were doing fine .
They did not make it to university .
They had bad grades . Some of them dropped out .
A few were still there with bad grades .
A few had good grades .
So what happened in Colombia ?
But she ate it .
But she will be successful .
That person ate the marshmallow .
If the sales person says , &quot; Wait a second .
Then you sell a lot more .
So this has applications in all walks of life .
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
Thank you so much .
It felt wrong to do that in some way .
I &apos;m focusing on biology , the biological sciences .
the areas that are the most significant to us .
It &apos;s because we &apos;re flesh and blood .
We &apos;re biological creatures .
And I &apos;m actually going to use his words in the same order that he did .
And thereby hangs a tale . &quot;
Life is short , you know .
And we need to think about planning a little bit .
This is where it &apos;s really central to our lives .
Now I know there &apos;s been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology .
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project .
We &apos;re deciphering the code of codes .
We &apos;re reading the book of life .
You know it &apos;s 2003 , and there is no HAL .
And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case .
And this is very critical stuff .
It &apos;s going to change the way we have children .
It &apos;s going to change the way we manage and alter our emotions .
It &apos;s going to probably change the human lifespan .
It will really make us question what it is to be a human being .
is the revolution in biology .
What we &apos;re doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future .
It &apos;s not at all clear where it &apos;s going to take us .
The most immediate changes that we &apos;ll see are things like in medicine .
But who is going to pay for all this ?
And how are we going to understand all this complex information ?
That &apos;s going to have amazing impacts .
The approval process is going to fall apart , actually .
It &apos;s too slow .
It &apos;s too risk-averse .
And it is really not suited for the future that we &apos;re moving into .
We &apos;re all identical to each other . Isn &apos;t it wonderful ? &quot;
To deny that that &apos;s the case is not a very good start on that .
It would change absolutely everything .
The second is modifying our emotions .
Probably not .
And if you don &apos;t , who are you going to be ?
Why do you do what you do ?
It &apos;s going to be very challenging to deal with .
The third area is reproduction .
The first is cloning .
It didn &apos;t happen .
It &apos;s a total media circus .
And when it does it &apos;s not going to be that big a deal .
It &apos;s already done to avoid rare diseases today .
Of course there is going to be genetic engineering .
It &apos;s a joke ; of course they wouldn &apos;t want to do that .
They &apos;ll want the new release .
They are really going to come to operate in this realm .
Now not everything that can be done should be done .
And it won &apos;t be done .
Humanity is going to go down this path .
And it &apos;s going to do so for two reasons .
It is being funded very very -- in a big way .
The second is , we &apos;re human .
That &apos;s what we do .
That &apos;s really the central one , I believe .
People can try and ban these things .
They undoubtedly will . They have .
It &apos;s going to drive these things from view .
So , sure , we need to debate these things .
That is simply not going to happen .
They touch us too deeply .
Other people are going to say , &quot; This is great .
This is the flowering of human endeavor . &quot;
It &apos;s not going to happen .
In fact this isn &apos;t just abstract .
So here we are .
And I don &apos;t think that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time .
You know it &apos;s a little bit like a birth .
Where there is this bloody , awful mess happens .
And then what comes out of it ? New life .
We &apos;re going to make lots of errors .
That &apos;s the way these things work .
It is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life .
It will always be remembered .
I think that we should be proud of it .
It &apos;s our health , it &apos;s our lives , it &apos;s our future , it &apos;s our children .
We are , definitely .
It &apos;s how we hold it in our hearts .
It &apos;s how we look at it .
Again , I &apos;ll use the words in the same order he did .
Thank you .
Philip Zimbardo : The demise of guys ?
Other than that , there &apos;s not much of a problem .
So what &apos;s the data ?
So the data on dropping out is amazing .
Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of school .
In Canada , five boys drop out for every three girls .
What &apos;s the evidence of wiping out ?
First , it &apos;s a new fear of intimacy .
And this is two kinds .
It &apos;s a social awkwardness .
It &apos;s a social awkwardness like you &apos;re a stranger in a foreign land .
The problem is these are arousal addictions .
Arousal addiction , you want different .
Drugs , you want more of the same -- different .
And the problem is the industry is supplying it .
And there &apos;s some guy watching a hundred , obviously .
So what &apos;s the solution ? It &apos;s not my job .
Ivan Krastev : Can democracy exist without trust ?
And plus , I &apos;m not going to give you any answers .
There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me .
As you have been told , I &apos;m Bulgarian .
But then the rain stopped , people went to vote .
The government and the opposition , they have been simply paralyzed .
You know who to arrest , who to negotiate with .
So the government decided to have the elections once again .
Democracy is the only game in town .
I mean the unemployed , the under-privileged .
And this is a major issue .
And I &apos;ll start with what went right .
It was the human rights moment .
But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s .
And you have more choice-driven societies .
And it was the birth of the global world .
And you have the Internet .
The very idea of political community totally has changed .
So this is what went right .
We start to like divorcing , if we &apos;re married at all .
All this was very much under attack .
The more democratic our societies have been , the more equal they have been becoming .
Now we have the reverse tendency .
The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality .
Now the elites basically have been liberated .
They &apos;re very mobile . You cannot tax them .
And basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution .
This is the other side of the things that we like .
What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people .
Before , revolutions used to have ideological names .
You have Facebook revolutions , Twitter revolutions .
This is probably true .
Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions .
Transparency is politics &apos; management of mistrust .
And by the way , mistrust was always very important for democracy .
This is why you have checks and balances .
So for me this is extremely important .
And the public was extremely all for it .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;d like to talk about my dad .
My dad has Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
That &apos;s a lot of people .
He got dementia anyway .
So I &apos;m preparing to get Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
And reading is just about impossible .
That all seems like win to me .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
I don &apos;t want to get Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I want to make a case .
This is called the candle problem .
Doesn &apos;t work .
It &apos;s an awesome idea . Doesn &apos;t work .
This shows the power of incentives .
To the second group he offered rewards .
It &apos;s a nice motivator .
Bonuses , commissions , their own reality show .
Incentivize them . That &apos;s how business works .
But that &apos;s not happening here .
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
Let me show you what I mean .
You : we &apos;re incentivizing .
What happened this time ?
You want to be looking around .
Software can do it faster .
Think about your own work .
Think about your own work .
The rules are mystifying .
The solution , if it exists at all , is surprising and not obvious .
Now , I mean it makes me crazy .
And this is not -- here &apos;s the thing .
This is not a feeling .
This is not a philosophy .
Standard of living is lower .
Same deal . A bunch of games , three levels of rewards .
What happens ?
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States .
That &apos;s the American experience .
We need a whole new approach .
Autonomy : the urge to direct our own lives .
I want to talk today only about autonomy .
In the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management .
Management did not emanate from nature .
Okay ? Somebody invented it .
And it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work forever .
Management is great .
Let me give you some examples .
It looks like less than half .
Atlassian is an Australian software company .
And they do something incredibly cool .
They call them FedEx Days .
Why ? Because you have to deliver something overnight .
Okay ? Radical amounts of autonomy .
In a ROWE people don &apos;t have schedules .
They show up when they want .
They just have to get their work done .
What happens ?
And I say , &quot; Nope . I have proof . &quot;
A few years later another encyclopedia got started .
Different model , right ?
Do it because you like to do it .
If they went head to head , who would win ? &quot;
This is the titanic battle between these two approaches .
This is the Thrilla &apos; in Manila .
Alright ? Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators .
And here is what science knows .
The drive to do things cause they matter .
I rest my case .
Gayle Tzemach Lemmon : Women entrepreneurs , example not exception
And we don &apos;t invest in what &apos;s invisible to us .
But this is the face of resilience .
So I was amazed .
Why are you so passionate ? &quot;
So maybe you could interview her . &quot;
And she was just the start .
But think about this .
Most people say women .
Why is that ?
And in many places , they &apos;re there .
China , women run 20 percent of all small businesses .
They are often ignored because they &apos;re harder to help .
She sells chocolates .
The great news is we already know what works .
Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us .
And that &apos;s just to start .
I think that is terrific .
You know why ?
We have so much room to grow .
We are not a special interest group .
We are the majority .
Thank you very much .
Why grow homes ? Because we can .
And there &apos;s a cause for that , all right .
We &apos;ve got McPeople , McCars , McHouses .
Well , it &apos;s been around for 2,500 years .
It fits into the environment . It is the environment .
It is the landscape , right ?
They &apos;re perfect .
And we know it &apos;s incredibly ugly .
&quot; Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha . &quot;
But somehow , it didn &apos;t matter about the publicity .
There was no money involved .
Human beings needed the light .
They needed the light to see .
I start with the notion of the ideograph .
What is the abstraction ?
The circle . The circle . It &apos;s so obvious .
The circle of life . The circle of Mufasa &apos;s mask .
And you see the mechanics .
You don &apos;t question that .
I love the apparent truth of theater .
You took pieces of sticks .
You added silk to the bottom .
That &apos;s what moves you .
It &apos;s the art of it .
Miranda : Do you love me ?
Ferdinand : Beyond all limit .
HM : They are both in either &apos;s powers .
Looking for business , governor ?
Caliban : Hast thou not dropped from heaven ?
Stephano : Out of the moon , I do assure thee .
Prospera : Caliban !
Caliban : This island is mine .
Sebastian : Draw thy sword .
And I , the king , shall love thee .
Ariel : I have made you mad .
and our little life is rounded with a sleep .
JT : Okay .
And all of a sudden , the audience &apos;s perspective changes .
It becomes something magically large .
It becomes the rainstorm .
Spider Man is not bound by gravity .
It &apos;s real , what &apos;s happening .
Bono : They &apos;re mythologies .
They &apos;re modern myths , these comic book heroes .
PP : They believe . JT : Ohhhh . What was that ?
Circus , rock &apos; n &apos; roll , drama .
Well , one last story , very quickly .
But it &apos;s very easy to climb up , is it not ?
Did you hear the lyrics ?
And no hiking boots .
I know you &apos;ve all been there .
I &apos;m in the crucible right now .
It &apos;s my trial by fire .
It &apos;s my company &apos;s trials by fire .
We survive because our theme song is &quot; Rise Above . &quot;
Boy falls from the sky , rise above .
I know you understand that .
Thank you .
Man , her office was packed .
But that doesn &apos;t mean that we can &apos;t .
It just takes a little bit more .
Not so much .
I took a school bus to the fancy side of town .
You had to survive .
You just had to do things sometimes .
She has an issue with authority .
She &apos;s not going to go anywhere . &quot;
And boy , they were like , &quot; What ? Why ?
Why would you want to do that ? &quot;
I need to be in class because I need to graduate . &quot;
How do you get to build those relationships ?
And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media .
We wanted those freedoms .
But we had to do it .
Our community deserved a new way of doing things .
Yeah , what if we get it wrong ?
But what if we get it right ?
And we did .
Well , we &apos;re making school worth coming to every day .
We make our kids feel like they matter to us .
These were played in the local trolley system .
Thank you .
Mustafa Akyol : Faith versus tradition in Islam
There was no separation of sexes .
They were together while praying .
And I noticed this in a very funny way .
Quite ironic .
Ironic , and it &apos;s also , I think , quite telling .
So the rituals came that way .
It &apos;s something terrible , horrible .
It was there for thousands of years .
It should be the citizen &apos;s decision .
And there are strengths in Islamic tradition .
There is no punishment on apostasy .
That interpretation is quite possible and feasible .
But that &apos;s not the case at all .
The context has changed .
You have anti-colonization .
That &apos;s one thing to remember .
They were asking for democracy ; they were asking for freedom .
They said that &quot; we want freedom ; we want democracy .
Of course , this is a long road .
Thanks so much .
Not very many of you .
So a couple .
That &apos;s okay .
This robot can &apos;t be creepy or uncanny .
He should be friendly and cute .
So meet Romo .
If I duck down , he &apos;ll follow me .
He &apos;s wary , so he &apos;ll keep his eyes on me .
If I come over here -- He &apos;s smart .
Thanks , little guy .
Bless you .
So here &apos;s the iPad .
And Romo will actually stream video to this device .
If I get in front of Romo here .
So I &apos;ll snap a picture .
You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo .
In fact , who would like to drive a robot ?
Okay . Awesome .
Here you go .
Thank you , Scott .
Thanks , Scott .
They change from person to person .
To be honest , I have no idea .
Thank you .
Greg Asner : Ecology from the air
Technology can change our understanding of nature .
Take for example the case of lions .
You &apos;ve heard this too , I can tell .
They just use a different strategy .
Basically , we need a high-tech accounting system .
The colors are going to be going from red to blue .
That &apos;s in the reds and yellows .
The forest is on the left .
Some of their decisions have really big impacts .
Thank you .
Shukla Bose : Teaching one child at a time
Neither am I a veteran social worker .
How many children will you get ?
How are you going to scale ?
How are you going to replicate ? &quot;
It was very difficult not to get scared , not to get daunted .
So , we started Parikrma .
Indian academic year begins in June .
My God ! What a bonding exercise that was .
No one in their family has spoken English .
But how wrong it is .
And this little boy has been coming to school for five years .
They &apos;ll never be able to cope . &quot;
That &apos;s absolute hogwash .
Fathers have started to attend .
Now they have started writing their signature .
The children have taught them .
It &apos;s amazing how much children can teach .
Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics .
We have taught them nutrition , hygiene .
I mingled with almost everyone .
They were very friendly .
Even now we are in touch through Facebook .
Before that I feel like I wasn &apos;t like this .
My accent with English improved a lot .
Such beautiful food , I enjoyed it . It was so beautiful .
And today she wants to be a neurologist .
They are really excelling .
We also have our very own dream team .
We also believe that it &apos;s the content that is more important .
We didn &apos;t hire McKinsey to do a business plan .
This is five-year-old Parusharam .
He &apos;s in kindergarten .
He has learned how to speak English .
I like eating . I like playing . &quot;
Now , &quot; horsing &quot; is going for a horse ride .
So , Parusharam comes to my office every day .
But today I have been transformed .
I have been changed with my children .
Thank you .
Richard St. John : 8 secrets of success
She said , &quot; What leads to success ? &quot;
So I get off the plane , and I come to TED .
And the first thing is passion .
Did he say fun ? Rupert ? Yes !
And push ! David Gallo says , &quot; Push yourself .
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smart enough .
I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d make it . &quot;
Because that &apos;s the way people really get rich . &quot;
I &apos;d say it was a pretty good idea .
And I give lots of evidence .
And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
I have to serve . &quot;
I met him at a 46664 event .
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot;
They work in the field .
They have education programs .
They bring out the issues of stigma .
It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
So this is my SING Campaign .
This is in the Scottish Parliament .
This can happen .
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
This is the transformation that took place .
Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
Thank you very much .
My subject today is learning .
And in that spirit , I want to spring on you all a pop quiz .
Ready ?
When does learning begin ?
Now I &apos;m a science reporter .
I write books and magazine articles .
And I &apos;m also a mother .
First of all , they learn the sound of their mothers &apos; voices .
How can we know this ?
It may have evolved to aid the baby &apos;s survival .
It &apos;s also tastes and smells .
And often it does something more .
The specter of mass starvation loomed .
Here &apos;s another story .
But there &apos;s another way of thinking about PTSD .
Let me be clear .
Thank you .
&quot; Do you have tenure ? &quot;
They are : the arts and parenting .
Let me start with the arts .
Well , in fact , the arts are not in decline .
Well , here &apos;s a diagnosis .
And here &apos;s just one example .
Well , you get the idea .
What a puzzle -- I wonder why .
Well , the other hot button is parenting .
The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results .
OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding .
And that presents us with a choice .
Thank you very much .
Lewis Pugh : How I swam the North Pole
He was a great storyteller .
He had been there and watched it go off .
I really , really wanted to go to the Arctic .
But seven years ago , I went to the Arctic for the first time .
I love the place .
And we need to do something about it right now .
Well , swimming across the North Pole , it &apos;s not an ordinary thing to do .
Fresh water freezes at zero .
It &apos;s fucking freezing .
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations .
It couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end .
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth .
So we stopped the ship , as you do .
I could barely breathe . I was gasping for air .
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes .
I climbed out of the ice .
And they were swollen so much , I couldn &apos;t even close them .
There is no possibility that this was going to happen .
For those of you who don &apos;t know him , he &apos;s the great British explorer .
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea .
We are going to actually have to take them off . &quot;
At the very best , I &apos;m going to end up losing some fingers .
And at worst , I didn &apos;t even want to think about it .
We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole .
This is such an important swim .
So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole .
There were open patches of sea everywhere .
And I went down into my cabin and I put on my swimming costume .
And then we walked out onto the ice .
I had never seen black water before .
And it is 4,200 meters deep .
Just scuttle forward and go for it . &quot;
Everything just looks so gray around here , and looks so cold .
We &apos;ve just seen our first polar bears .
It was absolutely magical .
It &apos;s a very frightening , very , very frightening thought .
It &apos;s all a little bit frightening , and emotional .
Amundson , you ready ? Amudson : Ready .
Lewis Pugh : Ten seconds to swim . Ten seconds to swim .
You did it ! You did it man !
LP : How on earth did we do that ?
Against the current ! You did it against the current !
LP : Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
Thank you so much .
Audience : Encore !
But was it worth it ? Yes , absolutely it was .
Britain , America , Japan , South Africa , the Congo .
All of us together , we &apos;re all on the same ship together .
We need to believe in ourselves .
Now is the time to believe .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very , very much .
So , I was in the hospital for a long time .
And what &apos;s the brilliant idea he had ?
What would happen then ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , don &apos;t worry about it , &quot; he said .
And he said , &quot; Dan , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric ?
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
None of those happened .
But I decided not to have this treatment .
Where was this guilt trip coming from ? &quot;
Right , that &apos;s what he seems like .
So I looked carefully at this guy .
&quot; Fantastic ! &quot; I thought . &quot; Let &apos;s throw him out .
Would we have thrown him out then ? &quot;
And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
But this was not the case .
Sebastian Thrun : Google &apos;s driverless car
Like this .
We built the hardware and the software .
We &apos;ve driven 140,000 miles .
It &apos;s the perfect driving mechanism .
Oh , my God .
What ?
Second It &apos;s driving itself .
You could regain this time .
And it &apos;s 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted .
Thank you .
Derek Sivers : Keep your goals to yourself
The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it &apos;s already done .
So , let &apos;s look at the proof .
So , if this is true , what can we do ?
Exactly , well done .
John Francis : Walk the earth ... my 17-year vow of silence
Thank you for being here .
And I said , &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot;
Well , I want to take you on this journey .
That &apos;s a big thing in California .
And I &apos;d say , &quot; Well , I &apos;m walking for the environment . &quot;
You &apos;re walking to make us feel bad . &quot;
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
I called my parents up .
I said , &quot; I &apos;ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know about the environment then .
They &apos;re back in Philadelphia .
Mothers are like that .
And so I did .
I got up in the morning and I didn &apos;t say a word .
And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
And then I would launch in .
Well , that just ended communication .
I didn &apos;t .
Well , that lasted 17 years .
It &apos;s only 500 miles .
I had a newspaper clipping .
You don &apos;t … ?
We have a special program for you . &quot; They did .
And my father came out , he was so proud .
There are two stories in Montana .
And they said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot;
You &apos;re going to go to South America , aren &apos;t you ? &quot;
So I did that .
They had to take that class with me .
&quot; Well , you can &apos;t clearcut with a ... &quot;
&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
I just backed out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fists from flying .
And so I went on .
What are you going to do with a master &apos;s degree ? &quot;
No one was interested in oil spills .
But something happened -- Exxon Valdez .
My dad came out again .
Well , I put on my backpack again .
And that &apos;s communication .
Really , very important -- we need to listen to each other .
Well , my journey kept going on .
&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
How could that be , how could that be ?
Well , my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time .
And so that &apos;s the message that I had .
And I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot;
And I looked at him and I said , &quot; Passport , huh ?
And I started walking off .
What possessed me to say this thing ?
The road turned into the jungle .
I didn &apos;t get shot .
Now how could that be ?
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
You know , we can do it .
I was going to have to change .
But I know I needed to .
We have to change now .
Thank you .
Arthur Benjamin : Teach statistics before calculus !
And at top of that pyramid , it &apos;s calculus .
It &apos;s understanding data .
It &apos;s analyzing trends . It &apos;s predicting the future .
Thank you very much .
Stephen Wolfram : Computing a theory of all knowledge
So I want to talk today about an idea . It &apos;s a big idea .
It &apos;s the idea of computation .
But there &apos;s actually a lot more to computation than that .
But what about the space of all possible programs ?
Here &apos;s a representation of a really simple program .
Very simple .
So let &apos;s try changing the rule for this program a little bit .
Try changing it again .
You get something a little bit more complicated .
Well , we can do a little experiment .
Let &apos;s just do a little mathematical experiment , try and find out .
They &apos;re called cellular automata .
So let &apos;s take a closer look at rule number 30 here .
So here it is .
So let &apos;s give it a try .
Hope for the best .
Very good . Okay .
So far so good .
Let &apos;s try something a little bit harder .
We could ask it something about the real world .
Let &apos;s say -- I don &apos;t know -- what &apos;s the GDP of Spain ?
And it should be able to tell us that .
let &apos;s say the revenue of Microsoft .
So let &apos;s say we have a lab finding that ...
Or let &apos;s try asking about , I don &apos;t know , the International Space Station .
So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things .
But that &apos;s just the beginning .
So , I &apos;m pretty pleased with it all .
You know , we have a fairly interesting situation right now .
Let me show you a couple of examples here .
So here &apos;s a trivial piece of Mathematica programming .
But it &apos;s something that is very precise stuff .
I think it &apos;s actually rather wonderful .
Here &apos;s a real simple example .
Let &apos;s try this here .
I &apos;ll show you one example here .
There &apos;s an inexhaustible supply of programs out there .
And each possible rule , in a sense , corresponds to a candidate universe .
So , will we find the whole of physics ?
Not an easy project .
One &apos;s got to build a lot of technology .
Thank you .
That was astonishing .
Stay here . I &apos;ve got a question .
So , that was , fair to say , an astonishing talk .
Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience .
Does your work relate to his ?
SW : I think so .
Stephen Wolfram , thank you .
But here &apos;s what really perplexed me .
It seemed so intuitive to me .
One more mind will be unlocked .
Thank you .
Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds .
Just think for a moment .
Damn it , even the books here are made out of plants .
All these things , they come back to plants .
And without them we wouldn &apos;t be here .
Now plants are under threat .
They &apos;re under threat because of changing climate .
I think it does .
is by storing seeds .
So here is the building ; it looks rather unassuming , really .
This is a nuclear-proof facility .
God forbid that it should have to withstand that .
And those are the dry land species .
So first of all we did deals with 50 different countries .
They search for them . They find them in flower .
And they go back when their seeds have arrived .
And they collect the seeds . All over the world .
The seeds -- some of if is very untechnical .
You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off .
And this is a distributed network .
And that enables us to develop germination protocols .
And that is very useful information .
And that &apos;s already happening .
So where have we got to ?
Twenty-five percent of all the world &apos;s plants , by 2020 .
These seeds are used for restoration .
How much does it cost ?
2,800 dollars per species is the average .
I think that &apos;s cheap , at the price .
And we &apos;re almost there .
Thank you very much .
Hillel Cooperman : Legos for grownups
So , these are the Dark Ages .
That stuff &apos;s cool . &quot;
Walked into the Lego store .
Bought him this .
It &apos;s totally appropriate for a four-year-old .
Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control .
The dining room looked like this .
You walk there , and it hurts .
Torture , very funny .
Wow , you guys are great .
And she said , &quot; No , the Lego is the treasure . &quot;
And then she said , &quot; Dad , we &apos;re Lego rich . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Yeah .
I suppose we are . &quot;
Whatever .
So then you realize there are these conventions .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; Holy shit !
Just beautiful .
And I was just like , &quot; Yeah , I guess I am .
I &apos;m coming out .
I &apos;m kind of into this stuff , and I &apos;m going to stop being embarrassed . &quot;
And it &apos;s pretty amazing actually .
I have to take a moment .
Okay . Anyway .
The insides were Lego .
This is amazing what you can do .
This is my house .
And this is my house .
Anyway , I &apos;m out of time .
Because there aren &apos;t enough TED logos around here .
Let &apos;s see here .
Okay .
Ta-da .
Ross Lovegrove : Organic design , inspired by nature
I was hanging on to have a pee .
I &apos;m in that world , but I work purely instinctively .
So , the water bottle .
I &apos;ll begin with this concept of what I call DNA .
Industrial design is the art form of the 21st century .
I work from a similar position .
It &apos;s my impression of water .
I use , now , a whole new process .
This is all created digitally .
This is the background noise of industrial design .
It felt like nothing . It has to feel like nothing .
It doesn &apos;t look as cool , does it ?
I design for that condition , biopolymers . It &apos;s the future .
I took this video in Cape Town last year .
This is the freaky side coming out .
How do you condense that ?
It comes back to instinct .
It &apos;s a weird , kind of freaky place .
This is one of my specimens .
It &apos;s made from polysaccharides and proteins .
If you pour water on that , it dissolves .
Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future ?
This is an absolutely beautiful way of working .
It &apos;s a godly way of working .
It &apos;s organic and it &apos;s essential .
I make organic things which are essential .
I set out to look at natural forms .
Wow . Let &apos;s go for it . That &apos;s the kind of stuff .
That is the power of organic design .
These actually are sold as artwork .
I &apos;ll tell you about that later .
It &apos;s a gas-injected polymer chair .
It &apos;s great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming .
This is some current work I &apos;m doing .
Some guy &apos;s got that on a computer -- there &apos;s this like , oh my goodness .
So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio .
This kind of effervescent , fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas .
I don &apos;t know . If I just got some time .
What a waste . Anyway .
That is an image of a car for me .
That &apos;s the car of the future . It &apos;s a water droplet .
Cars are all wrong .
They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this .
The only place that didn &apos;t laugh was Moscow .
Its cars are made from 30,000 components .
It opens and closes like a bread bin .
You plug them in . Off you jolly well go .
You see that thing . You do .
You do and not anaesthetized , separated from life .
Forget that . We move on .
I &apos;m trying to build furniture that fits architecture .
I &apos;m trying to build transportation systems .
This is the steriolithography of a staircase .
I built this thing for my studio .
It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this .
Modern materials allow us to do modern things .
This is a shot in the studio .
This is how it looks pretty much every day .
Who cares ?
That &apos;s my studio . It &apos;s subterranean .
It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day .
It &apos;s a bio-polycarbonate new chair I &apos;m doing in Italy .
We should all be riding one of these .
It &apos;s made from Kevlar .
We need to have a new instinct for the 21st century .
We need to combine all this stuff .
These are my sculptures .
A copper jelly mold .
It sounds like some quiz show or something , doesn &apos;t it ?
So , it &apos;s going to end .
Thank you , James , for your great inspiration .
Thank you very much .
And here &apos;s a prime example .
Well , we needn &apos;t have worried .
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana .
And surprisingly , it became a cult film .
But that &apos;s not always easy for us .
Sleep deprivation is extreme .
We &apos;re on the edge through a large part of the time .
I had tears rolling down my cheeks .
Now back to the leopard .
These are precious to us , these divides .
So we knew we had to react quickly .
It was like watching a graduation ceremony .
We felt like we were surrogate parents .
DJ : Okay , so she was a little bit rough .
They ended up sleeping for hours .
We had to deal with these individual personalities .
We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them .
It &apos;s simply not sustainable .
DJ : There &apos;s a burgeoning bone trade .
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market .
They &apos;re essential to the habitat .
And Legadema ?
BJ / DJ : Thank you very much .
BLA My journey to yo-yo mastery
One day , I bought a yo-yo .
When I tried my first trick , it looked like this .
A bit better .
I found my passion .
I was spending all my time practicing .
And I won .
Luca Turin : The science of scent
So what you &apos;re smelling now is the top note .
And then will come what they call the heart , the lush heart note .
I will show it to you .
And after that , the complete fragrance .
It &apos;s not really true .
OK , now . Why does this thing smell of cut grass , OK ?
But the first theory is : it must be the shape .
Now , this is a totally insane idea .
The way --I expect everybody to memorize these compounds .
Working for a fragrance company .
Because there &apos;s a lot of money in sandalwoods .
So this is a profoundly inefficient process .
A theory is something that enables you to do less work .
This is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol , and this smells of rotten eggs , OK ?
It &apos;s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition .
S-H , quite a different frequency .
You have a unique smell , a unique vibration .
Now the good news is , Boranes you can get hold of .
The bad news is they &apos;re rocket fuels .
However , I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually , and here is the beast .
if you measure the vibrational frequencies , they are the same as S-H .
And this is the main objection to the theory .
OK , great , we smell vibrations . How ? All right ?
This is a joke . I &apos;m a biologist , OK ?
So it &apos;s a joke against myself .
Unlike us , they won &apos;t fall off the cliff .
OK . Now . If something absorbs the energy , the electron can travel .
And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical , OK ?
And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin .
They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin .
And this is our new baby , called tonkene .
And people are very resistant to ideas , and rightly so .
Why should new ideas be accepted ?
But we &apos;re not actually doing it by astrology .
Thank you very much .
Marvin Minsky : Health and the human mind
But that &apos;s not the hard part . &quot;
So here &apos;s a list of problems that come up .
One nice problem is , what do we do about health ?
Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
How do we make stable societies ? Longevity .
Okay , there &apos;re lots of problems to worry about .
The problem is , how many people should there be ?
And it &apos;s a sort of choice we have to make .
And there &apos;s one solution that &apos;s probably only a few years off .
Timesharing is a little further off in the future .
The future must have some computers . &quot;
So one thing we can do is live longer .
So that &apos;s one way of going about it .
And when you &apos;re hungry , food becomes more attractive , and so forth .
Thank you .
So my name is Taylor Wilson .
So nuclear fusion is our energy future .
I decided I wanted to make a star .
Well it doesn &apos;t break even .
I built this in my garage .
So maybe I don &apos;t want to admit to that .
So thank you very much .
Luis von Ahn : Massive-scale online collaboration
Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
This person thought they needed to wait .
But then I started feeling bad .
So then I started feeling bad .
So let me explain how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .
Amazon , now with the Kindle , is trying to digitize books .
This is an image with text for every page of the book .
Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
So this is how the system works .
So for example , Ticketmaster .
So funny things can happen .
For example , we presented this word .
So we get this .
Oops .
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
Here &apos;s how it works .
That &apos;s how it works .
There are tens of thousands of these .
Some of them are very cute .
Some of them are funnier .
It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
First of all , translating the Web .
So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
A large fraction of it is in English .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
It makes a lot of mistakes .
Actually it was a forum post .
It was translated from Japanese into English .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question .
So he &apos;s just explaining something .
Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
So back to the question .
So we need people to translate the whole Web .
We could do that .
Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
So it would be very expensive .
The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
So people really , really want to learn a new language .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
People really can learn a language with it .
So people really do learn a language .
And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
So people really do learn a language .
So let me show you one example .
The top is the German .
You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
That &apos;s the current business model .
So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
This is totally biased towards the rich .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
So here &apos;s the site .
We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
So thank you .
Well , we know a few things .
And most of our work &apos;s pretty non-invasive .
Now , dolphins are natural acousticians .
But they have other communication signals they use .
They have taste , not smell .
And they have touch .
This is the dolphin &apos;s sonar .
And they use these clicks to hunt and feed .
Don &apos;t tell anyone . It &apos;s a secret .
There &apos;s a bubble .
For example , they babysit each other &apos;s calves .
But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery .
Now , these are three spectragrams .
Now in this footage , the adult is Caroh .
She &apos;s kind of teasing him and taunting him .
He really wants that sargassum .
And these are artificially created whistles .
Now this is video of a session .
You have to keep their attention .
That &apos;s the rope whistle .
Up come the dolphins , and drop off the rope , yay . Wow .
So this is only once .
Okay , so here &apos;s a second toy in the water .
And I &apos;m trying to lead her back to the keyboard .
So I try to give her the scarf .
Whoop . Almost lost it .
But this is the moment where everything becomes possible .
The dolphin &apos;s at the keyboard .
You &apos;ve got full attention .
And this sometimes went on for hours .
And we &apos;re at prototype stage , but this is how we hope it will play out .
It &apos;s designed to really be two-way .
Thank you .
Thomas Heatherwick : Building the Seed Cathedral
Hello , my name is Thomas Heatherwick .
And this influenced me .
The first building I built was 20 years ago .
This is a hospital building .
This is a shop for a bag company .
This is studios for artists .
And this is a window display .
And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain .
But they aren &apos;t in London .
And so you &apos;re stuck on a bus .
So it &apos;s got hybrid drive .
I was going to show four main projects .
And this is a project for a bridge .
And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
I think we all kind of stand and watch .
And so this is in Paddington in London .
And it &apos;s a very boring bridge , as you can see .
It &apos;s just steel and timber .
So that &apos;s it speeded up .
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live .
So it felt this has a social dimension .
It has a symbolic importance .
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference .
And it &apos;s a power park .
So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion .
And an expo is a totally bonkers thing .
There &apos;s 250 pavilions .
It &apos;s the world &apos;s biggest ever expo that had ever happened .
So there are up to a million people there everyday .
And 250 countries all competing .
So we suddenly realized that there was this thing .
And the same with flowers .
I &apos;ve never met anyone who says , &quot; I don &apos;t like flowers . &quot;
But this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
But how could we show these teeny-weeny things ?
We didn &apos;t want to make a separate building and have separate content .
So we were trying to think , how could we make a whole thing emanate .
Thomas Heatherwick : Okay , you get the idea .
And to make the project affordable , we focused our energy .
And so the rest of the site was a public space .
There &apos;s just silence and a cool temperature .
A key thing was how people would interact .
And I just wanted to show you .
And there was a lot of terror .
But there was an underlying support .
And so there was a moment when suddenly -- actually , the next thing .
Children : One , two , three , go .
So finally , texture is something .
And it &apos;s in a piece of land that &apos;s this site .
So we &apos;re building these buildings .
They &apos;re just chopped at different heights .
And that &apos;s my final slide .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So thank you . Thank you , Thomas . You &apos;re a delight .
So there were 66,000 of these .
This optic was 22 feet long .
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy .
Thank you , Thomas .
Juan Enriquez : Your online life , permanent as a tattoo
Right ?
&#91; Beautiful &#93; &#91; Intriguing &#93; So you don &apos;t have to say a lot .
A few , but not most .
And electronic tattoos also shout .
So what if Andy was wrong ?
Here &apos;s Andy &apos;s theory .
Why the Greeks ?
So lesson number one : Sisyphus .
It &apos;s a little like your reputation .
Lesson number three : Atalanta .
Greatest runner . She would challenge anybody .
If you won , she would marry you .
If you lost , you died .
How did Hippomenes beat her ?
And then , of course , there &apos;s Narcissus .
Thank you .
How web video powers global innovation
I mean , it &apos;s quite brutal .
And I &apos;m also a little nervous about this .
So , let &apos;s explore .
This kid is known online as Lil Demon .
How did he learn them ?
Here &apos;s a clue .
It felt like a revolution .
What is going on here ?
You turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
The second thing you need is light .
And third , you need desire .
It &apos;s based on hundreds of hours of research , of practice .
There &apos;s probably going to be some innovation happening here .
The dance community is now global .
There &apos;s millions connected .
That &apos;s a lot of light .
But the desire element is really dialed way up .
Also , the system is self-fueling .
The dark side of the web is allergic to the light .
But you can publish your stuff online .
We are learning from them .
The wheel is turning .
Okay , step back a minute .
We &apos;re a social species .
We spark off each other .
Suddenly , here we are .
I don &apos;t think it will be .
Here , let me introduce you to Sam Haber .
He &apos;s a unicyclist .
Suddenly , he starts to emulate and then to innovate .
There &apos;s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
But look at this video .
Why do people like watching TEDTalks ?
It &apos;s actually faster to read than to view .
Why would someone bother ?
Well , so , there &apos;s some showing as well as telling .
Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions .
It &apos;s probably driven our culture for millennia .
It &apos;s right here .
Print scaled .
But now , in the blink of an eye , the game has changed again .
that just went global .
Now , this is big .
Now , TED is just a small part of this .
Our future is many-to-many .
It &apos;s the participation age , right ?
Schools can &apos;t be silos .
We can &apos;t stop learning at age 21 .
What if , in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
That changes everything , right ?
Who &apos;s the teacher ?
You &apos;re the teacher .
Christopher Makau : Hi . My name is Christopher Makau .
There &apos;s a self-help group .
They turned a trash place into a garden .
The same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
We have our own film school .
Today , I see Kibera in a different way .
You know what ?
Thank you .
And thank you .
Aimee Mullins : My 12 pairs of legs
But , of course , that &apos;s the point .
And immediately a voice shouted , &quot; Kangaroo ! &quot;
&quot; No , no , no ! Should be a frog ! &quot;
&quot; No . It should be Go Go Gadget ! &quot;
&quot; No , no , no ! It should be the Incredibles . &quot;
And other things that I don &apos;t -- aren &apos;t familiar with .
Interesting .
This started an incredible journey .
You don &apos;t look disabled . &quot;
What does a beautiful woman have to look like ?
What is a sexy body ?
Nobody calls her disabled .
Poetry matters .
Heavy !
That &apos;s a good close-up of that one .
So whimsy matters .
Today , I &apos;m 6 &apos; 1 &quot; .
And I said , &quot; I know . Isn &apos;t it fun ? &quot;
And I was having fun with it .
And the incredible thing was she really meant it .
It &apos;s a conversation about potential .
Thank you .
Anna Deavere Smith : Four American characters
You see , we also have the technology .
I say , less and less the human touch .
And there &apos;s a voice on the train , you know the voice was a human voice .
You see in the old days we had robots , robots imitated humans .
Now we have humans imitating robots .
Concourse Two : Dallas , Fort Worth . Same voice .
And so suddenly they &apos;re looking at me .
&quot; Just then I see a baby , a little baby in the lap of a mother .
You know , you see , you &apos;ve got to question the official truth .
I mean , Huck , of course , was tremendous .
So the human touch , you see , it &apos;s disappearing .
And that &apos;s Studs Terkel .
So this piece is about a negative imagination .
And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins .
And it didn &apos;t work , didn &apos;t work .
And she would hit her head on the tub . It happened continuously , repeatedly .
I could hear it , but I dared not to move . I didn &apos;t move .
I just sat there and listened .
And then he put her in the hallway .
And then he told her , get up .
Her face was bruised . She had a black eye .
&quot; The next morning she was dead .
And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway .
So that &apos;s an investigation of the negative imagination .
Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way .
&quot; I used to believe America was the best .
I never saw any poor man , any black .
Why ? Why do we have to be left out ?
&quot; OK . OK ? OK . OK .
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants .
They became so hilarious , but I was happy for them .
I wish that I could live together with black people .
But after the riot , it &apos;s too much difference .
The fire is still there . How do you say it ? &#91; Unclear &#93; .
Igniting , igniting , igniting fire . Igniting fire .
Mrs. Young-Soon Han .
And this is called &quot; Toughness . &quot;
It seems like he has so much bad luck , you know .
I think that &apos;s good luck .
&quot; And , I mean , funny things like this happen .
She said , &apos; Look who she is .
&quot; Freedom ? It would have to be the rodeo .
Well , you know , I guess that &apos;d have to be the rodeo too .
Thank you .
Aaron Koblin : Visualizing ourselves ... with crowd-sourced data
This is a project called Flight Patterns .
Everybody &apos;s moving from the East coast to the West coast .
And you can zoom in . This is taking a look at Atlanta .
See again , the diversity .
This is scrolling up the East coast .
And you can see , over time , the ways the airports change .
And you can see , eventually the airport actually flips directions .
This is visualizing international communications .
So it &apos;s how New York communicates with other international cities .
And then you can see people celebrating the next day .
So now on to something completely different .
Some of you may recognize this .
The nerdy side of me thought , &quot; Wow , this is amazing .
I can tap into thousands of people &apos;s minds . &quot;
I was probably being a little extreme .
So I created this drawing tool .
And I started collecting sheep .
And I collected a lot , a lot of different sheep .
Lots of sheep .
Kind of amazing what some people did .
So here &apos;s a few statistics from the project .
Which I was pretty surprised by .
And I think it &apos;s a pretty valid question .
And there &apos;s a lot of reasons why I chose sheep .
And I like that .
We asked people to draw what it was that they saw .
This is again showing all the different contributions .
You may recognize these two guys .
So we resynthesized this song .
This is what that sounded like .
You &apos;d be fed a simple audio clip .
I &apos;m sorry for this .
So basically motion through 3D space .
So we did exactly that .
And people were making some amazing things .
And I met a music video director named Chris Milk .
One is the beginning of the music video .
Collaborator : I felt really sad when he died .
You &apos;re hearing a person &apos;s life .
And you can also see the way that it was drawn .
But there &apos;s a bunch of different styles .
And this is called &quot; The Wilderness Downtown . &quot;
It &apos;s an online music video for the Arcade Fire .
Thanks a lot .
Donald Sadoway : The missing link to renewable energy
But coal plants , nuclear plants can &apos;t respond fast enough .
A giant battery could .
And that changes everything .
It &apos;s called the liquid metal battery .
Now the theme of this year &apos;s TED Conference is Full Spectrum .
Now let &apos;s get started .
The science is that simple .
Admittedly , I &apos;ve left out a few details .
We need to think about the problem differently .
I &apos;m talking about the production of aluminum .
Volta &apos;s battery works at room temperature .
And I did .
I &apos;ll show you how .
So now , how to choose the metals ?
And that includes our own bodies .
Magnesium for the top layer .
And antimony for the bottom layer .
It could be something like a wind farm .
And then we reverse the current .
It &apos;s pretty cool , at least in theory .
But does it really work ?
So what to do next ?
We go to the laboratory .
Now do I hire seasoned professionals ?
I called it the shotglass .
I call it the hockey puck .
And we got the same remarkable results .
And then it was onto the saucer .
That &apos;s 200 watt-hours .
But the pace wasn &apos;t fast enough for us .
We call that the pizza .
It &apos;s going to be 36 inches in diameter .
So what have we learned from all this ?
They lie beyond the visible .
Avoid thermal runaway .
Malcolm Gladwell : Choice , happiness and spaghetti sauce
And by profession , he &apos;s a psychophysicist .
And Howard is very interested in measuring things .
Howard is not so easily placated .
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards .
This was an enormous revelation .
You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis . &quot;
And they would say , you know , &quot; Move ! Next ! &quot;
And that &apos;s where we got zesty pickles .
That &apos;s called &quot; adherence . &quot;
So they came to Howard , and they said , fix us .
So he said , this is what I want to do .
And then he analyzed the data .
Howard doesn &apos;t believe that there is such a thing .
Now why is that important ?
It &apos;s a mystery !
What do you like ? Dark , rich , hearty roast !
Most of you like milky , weak coffee .
So that &apos;s number one thing that Howard did .
Takes over the mustard business !
And Howard looked to that and said , that &apos;s wrong !
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy .
There is no good mustard or bad mustard .
What do I mean by that ?
This is the way it ought to be .
The culture of tomato sauce was thin .
And that &apos;s what would please the maximum number of people .
They were looking for one way to treat all of us .
But that changed , right ?
And the example he used was coffee .
Thank you .
The guys says he &apos;s looking for his keys .
And this is about a 5,000-year-old technology .
You just had teams of hundreds of people .
Now 1995 , obviously that was quite a long time ago .
It was a Palm Pilot .
And it actually worked great .
So what do I mean by that ?
That means you had to know I existed .
So these guys are distributing technology .
I need to think about this some more .
They don &apos;t require any programmers .
You just have to hear about it and go to the website .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did .
No one has to speak to me .
You just have to hear about it and go to the website .
And the great part about this is , it &apos;s just like Hotmail .
But there are some additional benefits as well .
Unbelievable improvements in efficiency .
And I think it should be obvious .
Thank you .
Rory Sutherland : Sweat the small stuff
Let me give you one example of this .
Has anybody stayed there ?
It actually says garage , funk , rhythm and blues .
It &apos;s a tiny , tiny thing .
What can we do and encourage more online banking ? &quot;
I said , &quot; It &apos;s really , really easy . &quot;
Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news ?
Okay , you simply wouldn &apos;t .
And yet , it never happens .
That &apos;s the world people actually want .
And I &apos;d be wrong to dis that completely .
That &apos;s called trivia .
But there &apos;s a fourth thing .
We don &apos;t know what to call it .
Thank you very much .
Kristen Ashburn : The face of AIDS in Africa
For instance , this is Herbert with his grandmother .
This is Joyce who &apos;s -- in this picture -- 21 .
Single mother , HIV positive .
So a few of the stories .
All these pictures are from Zimbabwe .
Kirsten Ashburn : Mmm , gosh .
It was just frightening .
That &apos;s an amazing story , thank you .
Alessandro Acquisti : What will a future without secrets look like ?
You know the incident .
They freak out .
And the rest is history .
Nowadays , Adam and Eve would probably act differently .
And my story is about these tradeoffs .
Do you see the subject ?
Well , the computer did , and in fact did so for one out of three subjects .
But a few years back , we did something else .
Of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
In fact , take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme .
And should we care ?
Or in a parallel universe , you find this information .
But think again . Why should that be always the case ?
And in principle , that &apos;s a very good thing .
It &apos;s necessary , but it is not sufficient .
Transparency can be misdirected .
It makes sense , right ?
But then we added the misdirection .
Ten minutes ?
Five minutes ?
One minute ?
How about 15 seconds ?
We can browse the Internet anonymously .
Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden .
In the garden , Adam and Eve are materially content .
They &apos;re happy . They are satisfied .
However , they also lack knowledge and self-awareness .
They become aware . They achieve autonomy .
The price to pay , however , is leaving the garden .
We get free content .
We get to play Angry Birds . We get targeted apps .
Thank you .
May El-Khalil : Making peace is a marathon
I used to be a marathon runner .
So we had to start from scratch .
We spoke one common language to each other , and that was from one human to another .
The marathon grew .
So did our political problems .
But we did have a marathon .
They even hosted juice stations .
BMA has expanded .
Thank you .
Stereotypes have been broken .
From Boston to Beirut , we stand as one .
It is more of a marathon .
Thank you .
Sheryl WuDunn : Our century &apos;s greatest injustice
It , however , is enormous in both scale and importance .
So , let &apos;s start off in China .
This photo was taken two weeks ago .
But this is Tiananmen Square .
Let me take you to the real China .
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts .
Why would we waste this money on you ? &quot;
He was delighted .
He thought , &quot; Oh , I can renovate the school .
So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school .
She went to high school .
She went to vocational school for accounting .
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south .
She sent money back to her family .
What we saw was a natural experiment .
The village became a real standout .
In the 19th century , it was slavery .
In the 20th century , it was totalitarianism .
She &apos;s exaggerating . &quot;
Well , let me ask you this question .
Hands up , please .
Okay , most of you .
Well , you know this latter group , you &apos;re wrong .
And , you know , it happens for several reasons .
Sometimes it &apos;s also because of the sonogram .
Poverty , for instance .
There are three reasons why this is the case .
For one , overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty .
The second reason is it has to do with spending .
alcohol , tobacco , sugary drinks -- and prostitution and festivals .
You need to use scarce resources .
Do you think we &apos;ll make it ? &quot;
So here is Bill of Arabia .
So what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
And I &apos;ll just say two things about this .
And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula .
Let me tell you about Mahabuba .
She lives in Ethiopia .
In a word , she stank .
That night , there was a stick in the hut .
I &apos;ve hinted at them : education and also economic opportunity .
Let me tell you about Saima .
And at the time , she was miserable .
Saima &apos;s not going to produce you a son . &quot;
So now they &apos;re in it together .
Which brings me to the final element , which is education .
Heifer sent two goats to Africa .
The twins started producing milk .
They sold the milk for cash .
No matter , she was just delighted to be in school .
She rocketed to the top of her class .
Two years ago , she graduated from Connecticut College .
And that goat was $ 120 .
There &apos;s Bill Easterly &apos;s book .
There &apos;s a book called &quot; Dead Aid . &quot;
He sort of mumbled .
Turns out that it &apos;s a failed irrigation project .
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop .
So then , I ask , what &apos;s in it for you ?
I will just leave you with two things .
Throughout her time there , she was strong , she was steadfast .
She never broke down .
What that was was a bird feeder .
So , here &apos;s the cause .
Join the movement .
Feel happier and help save the world .
Thank you very much .
Francis Collins : We need better drugs -- now
So let me ask for a show of hands .
How many people here are over the age of 48 ?
Well , there do seem to be a few .
Now , that &apos;s the good news .
But there &apos;s still a lot of work to do .
Only about 250 .
Well , wouldn &apos;t it be nice if it was that easy ?
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not .
There are no shiny bridges .
You sort of place your bets .
Well , what does this really look like ?
How can we make this go faster ?
How can we make it more successful ?
Well , let me tell you about a few examples where this has actually worked .
That picture you see there ?
Here it is . That &apos;s the same kid .
That &apos;s the good news .
How do we go faster ?
Well , that &apos;s exciting .
How does that play out in terms of application to a disease ?
This one is a disorder which is quite rare .
Sam , please have a seat .
Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam .
SB : Thank you very much . FC : Well done . Well done , buddy .
And you could expect quite a lot to come from this .
It was developed for cancer . It was AZT .
So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort ?
Suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
It has an air channel . It has a blood channel .
Are those cells happy or not ?
So let me sum up .
We are in a remarkable moment here .
I hope that &apos;s your goal .
It matters for now . It matters as soon as possible .
If you don &apos;t believe me , just ask Sam .
Thank you all very much .
Lucy McRae : How can technology transform the human body ?
I call myself a body architect .
I started my own experiments .
Or the way that we attract sexual partners ?
It &apos;s perfume coming from the inside out .
And I feel like I &apos;ve just got started .
So here &apos;s to another day at the office .
Thank you !
Thank you !
Sally Kohn : Let &apos;s try emotional correctness
So when I do my job , people hate me .
I am a gay talking head on Fox News .
So I go on television .
It &apos;s totally almost just like that .
And that &apos;s just on air .
Let me give you a small example .
I care about two things .
One , I care that you spell it right .
Just quick refresher , it &apos;s D-Y-K-E .
You &apos;d totally be surprised .
Or do you really want to hurt me personally ?
Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct .
That , by the way , in case you &apos;re paying attention , is not emotionally correct .
Now here &apos;s the kicker .
Conservatives are really nice .
That is emotional correctness .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
Now this guy doesn &apos;t agree with me , yet .
Thank you .
Seth Godin : The tribes we lead
Unfortunately I couldn &apos;t go .
Sometimes they get in trouble , but not often .
They make balloon animals .
But what do we do for a living ?
We try to make big , permanent , important change .
And I &apos;ve been studying it for a couple years .
First , about a guy named Nathan Winograd .
And everyone said it was impossible .
And he went to Reno and he did it again .
It is a moment in time .
So let me tell you about the three cycles . The first one is the factory cycle .
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea .
Because he &apos;s got an efficient enough factory .
You can change the fabric of an entire country .
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines .
Take a good idea and push it on the world .
I have a better mousetrap .
If necessary you can put babies in your ads .
But be careful .
But there is good news around the corner -- really good news .
I call it the idea of tribes .
It &apos;s about leading and connecting people and ideas .
And it &apos;s something that people have wanted forever .
You &apos;ve got the organized armies over here .
You &apos;ve got the disorganized rebels over here .
You &apos;ve got people in white hats making food .
And people in white hats sailing boats .
But they always stop and take a picture .
They &apos;ve got their own flag . They &apos;ve got the eye patches .
And he didn &apos;t do it by buying a lot of ads .
He did it by creating a movement .
You don &apos;t need everyone .
And some people will get people to be on the other team .
But let me just try a couple .
The Beatles did not invent teenagers .
They merely decided to lead them .
Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians .
He just stepped up and said , &quot; Follow me . &quot;
I see what the status quo is ; I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
We need to organize around it . &quot;
So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store .
Zappos isn &apos;t a shoe store .
It &apos;s exactly the same behavior though .
We &apos;re just waiting for someone to lead us . &quot;
And around and around and around it goes .
So three questions I &apos;d offer you .
The first one is , who exactly are you upsetting ?
The second question is , who are you connecting ?
And the third one is , who are you leading ?
It &apos;s a story of a product that tells a story .
It &apos;s tens of thousands of pairs of shoes .
They need the leadership . It makes a difference .
They challenge what &apos;s currently there .
The second thing is , they build a culture .
They connect people to one another .
They want to be missed .
Being a leader gives you charisma .
Finally , they commit .
They commit to the cause . They commit to the tribe .
They commit to the people who are there .
So I &apos;d like you to do something for me .
Thank you very much . I appreciate it .
Lee Hotz : Inside an Antarctic time machine
It &apos;s urgent work . We know that temperatures are rising .
It &apos;s really a time machine .
Yes , I said that with a Q , quadrillion .
From this , we can detect an extraordinary number of things .
Why do we need to study this anymore ?
This process requires extraordinary precautions .
They work against the clock and against the thermometer .
Here , the ice seems a living presence .
The wind that rubs against it gives it voice .
It is a voice of experience .
It is a voice we should heed .
Thank you .
Bill Ford : A future beyond traffic gridlock
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company .
So my parents would go to dinner .
They &apos;d sit down ; I &apos;d sneak out of the house .
And it was snowing that day .
My dad finished dinner early that evening .
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while .
But I really began to love cars then .
And that &apos;s a belief that I share .
My other great passion is the environment .
Well I think you probably already have the picture .
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised .
So what &apos;s going to solve this ?
Well the answer isn &apos;t going to be more of the same .
But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless .
So let &apos;s get started now .
Thank you .
John Hardy : My green school dream
I had a really hard time in school .
I ran away .
So here &apos;s the world , and here we are in Bali .
It has an intact Hindu culture .
Cynthia and I were there .
We decided to give back locally .
And here it is : it &apos;s called the Green School .
The classrooms have no walls .
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard .
The desks are not square .
And we practice holism .
Would he have had more possibilities in his life ?
The classrooms have natural light .
They &apos;re beautiful . They &apos;re bamboo .
The breeze passes through them .
So we basically turned the box into a bubble .
But since that happened , they own those desks .
And you know what these are .
There &apos;s nowhere to flush .
How many people times how much water .
There isn &apos;t enough water .
And they work . People use them . People are okay .
Not many things didn &apos;t work .
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic .
I said , &quot; Welcome to Green School . &quot;
I asked him , &quot; Why ? &quot;
In August I &apos;m bringing my sons . &quot;
This was a great thing .
It &apos;s becoming a community .
It &apos;s becoming a green model .
We had to look at everything .
No petrochemicals in the pavement .
No pavement .
There are no sidewalks .
This is the school buffalo .
He &apos;s planning to eat that fence for dinner .
All the fences at Green School are green .
Landscaping .
We dropped them gently in .
This young man is picking organic vegetables .
The food is incredible .
The kids are from 25 countries .
But you also learn other things .
You learn bamboo building .
The kids love it .
The mothers aren &apos;t quite convinced .
And we were right .
We need someone to come and study it .
And all the kids are thriving .
And how did we do all this ?
On giant grass .
It &apos;s bamboo .
It comes out of the ground like a train .
The yellow box was called the administration complex .
It &apos;s a double helix .
So we built big models .
We had them engineered by the engineers .
It was chaos .
We believe it is .
It &apos;s a model we built for Bali .
So , Mr. Gore , thank you .
Thank you .
Good afternoon .
This issue isn &apos;t just theoretical .
Estonia accused Russia .
Thank you .
Who has an Android phone ?
Who has a Blackberry ?
But first , I &apos;m going to ask you some other questions .
You don &apos;t have to put your hands up .
These are rhetorical .
Actually , it isn &apos;t .
What it is is a map of innovation .
So where it &apos;s happening is in Africa .
Why ? Because we have to .
Because we have real problems .
Fantastic . Why do you even need a credit card ?
Why ? Because that &apos;s what we need .
We have really severe energy problems in Africa .
I come from Johannesburg , which is a mining town .
It &apos;s built on gold .
So what are some of the things that you can do with it ?
Really simple , using a basic phone .
If you don &apos;t have electricity , no problem !
He comes from Pretoria , the capital of &#91; South Africa &#93; , about 50 kilometers from where I live .
I believe we are the gold .
This is innovation over the edge .
So there &apos;s only one thing left to say .
&#91; &quot; You &apos;re welcome &quot; &#93;
Hans Rosling : The good news of the decade ?
They &apos;re called Millennium Development Goals .
So there &apos;s good news .
And I will take Kenya as an example .
Here you see the data .
What is the origin of the data ?
We have interviews , we have surveys .
How many children did you have ?
Are they alive ?
But they have good quality .
So this is a limitation .
This was 1977 , 1988 , 1992 , &apos; 97 and 2002 .
And when the experts in the U.N.
It was so tragic .
I was so happy .
This was the estimate of the new survey .
Isn &apos;t it nice -- isn &apos;t it nice , yeah ?
So we celebrated .
They start &#91; in &#93; 1990 -- they measure to 2009 .
They say , &quot; 0.9 percent , no progress . &quot;
That &apos;s unfair .
They have 2.4 percent .
We have a decent trend .
The HIV epidemic peaked .
We got , later , the mosquito netting .
And &#91; the &#93; U.N. says it &apos;s a reduction with 1.8 percent .
Now this sounds a little theoretical , but it &apos;s not so theoretical .
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of &#91; the &#93; economy .
An economist would never do that .
I have just divided it into two periods .
In the 90s , only 1.2 percent , only 1.2 percent .
Still here , child death per 1,000 on that axis .
Here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
And what has happened over the years since then ? Here we go .
But then , in the &apos; 80s , watch out here .
Ghana got very ahead , fast .
That &apos;s where we are today .
And they are judged , each country , on how they are doing .
And then , you see , these were famine years .
My ancestors moved to the United States .
And eventually , soon they started to get better and better here .
We had primary school actually started in 1842 .
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long-term investments .
So we are off track -- that &apos;s what Sweden is .
But you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
And down they went , you know .
And isn &apos;t it a success story .
Kenya is now speeding up .
Here we have a problem .
The relationship between child mortality and family size .
This is , once again , 1960 -- 50 years ago .
And the size of the bubble is the population .
And these are the so-called &quot; developing &quot; countries .
And the ones over there , they were so-called Western countries .
What has happened ?
This is what happened . Now I start the world .
It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here .
And here Brazil is in the Western Box .
Welcome to a decent life .
Come on . We want everyone down there .
This is the vision we have , isn &apos;t it .
And look now , the first African countries here are coming in .
There we are today .
Huh ?
They have here Singapore .
They have the lowest child mortality in the world , Singapore .
They have here Qatar .
This is crap .
The rest here is good -- the rest is good .
What is the importance now with the relations here .
It &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
Let &apos;s be clear about that .
And that is fully possible . Let &apos;s do it .
Thank you very much .
So case closed , right ?
Wrong .
And this can take quite a while .
And they started settling out .
with no employees .
&quot; And we &apos;d like to go ahead and close this out .
My response : &quot; How about nothing ? ! &quot;
We didn &apos;t have high hopes for that outcome .
But they settled .
No counter offer .
Now how did that happen ?
It came back signed .
Now why ? You can call them .
They &apos;re not under NDA either .
Patents are very difficult to overturn .
Infringement is a lot easier to disprove .
Don &apos;t forget that .
So what does all this mean ?
And what do they do with that money ?
Thank you .
Clay Shirky : Why SOPA is a bad idea
I &apos;m going to start here .
And it &apos;s a copyright violation .
So there &apos;s two bills in Congress right now .
One is called SOPA , the other is called PIPA .
It &apos;s from the Senate .
They want to take them out of the domain name system .
But technology moved on , as technology is wont to do .
We don &apos;t really like to only consume .
That was the level of rhetoric .
And Congress did something .
But this taping business , fine , let it go .
But that wasn &apos;t what the media businesses wanted .
They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full-stop .
So they went for plan B.
It took them a while to formulate plan B.
It was a complicated piece of legislation , a lot of moving parts .
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation .
We share written things , we share images , we share audio , we share video .
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve made .
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve found .
So PIPA and SOPA are round two .
So this is the Internet they have in mind .
That &apos;s the easy thing .
That &apos;s the simple thing .
And what they want is not to have to do that .
They just want the sharing to go away .
That &apos;s the way to handle this .
In the meantime , the hard thing to do is to be ready .
Thank you .
I &apos;d like to begin with four questions .
Would you be able to do that ?
I &apos;m not quite sure how he died , actually .
Was he beheaded in the end , or hung ?
But , actually , we don &apos;t do that .
That &apos;s what plants actually do for a living .
Now , here &apos;s how you do the battery and the bulb .
So , why is it hotter in summer than in winter ?
I promise you that most of you will have got that .
Other ones are kind of going like this . All right .
OK , now , the scribble of the diagram of the solar system .
So , here &apos;s Copernicus &apos; view of what the solar system looked like as a plan .
It &apos;s a plan , looking down from above .
So you &apos;ve -- it &apos;s crap , isn &apos;t it really ? As we say .
And the Exploratorium does that really , really well .
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good .
And you &apos;ve all got an idea in your head of the answer .
So , why is it blue on cloudy days ? Ah , see .
Thank you very much .
Now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
Vilayanur Ramachandran : The neurons that shaped civilization
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain .
So , how do you go about studying the brain ?
And this is truly astonishing .
Well , why is that important ?
Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next slide .
So , how do you do imitation ? Why is imitation important ?
Mirror neurons and imitation , emulation .
All of that happened relatively quickly .
And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense .
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy .
Fahad Al-Attiya : A country with no water
Salaam alaikum .
Welcome to Doha .
I am in charge of making this country &apos;s food secure .
So going in , what was Qatar in the 1940s ?
We were about 11,000 people living here .
None of the glamour that you see today existed .
It wasn &apos;t that they couldn &apos;t develop cities .
Resources weren &apos;t there to develop them .
And you can see that life expectancy was also short .
Most people died around the age of 50 .
So let &apos;s move to chapter two : the oil era .
1939 , that &apos;s when they discovered oil .
What did it do ?
Because we lived scattered .
People started to get to know each other .
So that is the chapter two : the oil era .
Let &apos;s look at today .
So what &apos;s the population today ?
It &apos;s 1.7 million people .
That is in less than 60 years .
Lifespan has increased to 78 .
Water consumption has increased to 430 liters .
Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water .
This is history being made in this region .
But of course , with the use of technology .
So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain .
Qatar has 74 , and we have that growth rate .
The question is how .
How could we survive that ?
We have no water whatsoever .
That is our river .
So what are the risks ?
Do you worry much ?
There is growing demand , growing population .
And so that number also demands food .
There &apos;s also changing diets .
We only have two days of water reserve .
Is there a sustainable solution ?
Indeed there is .
Let &apos;s start with the water .
A depletable energy ? Fossil fuel ?
Or should we use something else ?
And that is a lot of water .
Without it we can &apos;t do anything .
So that &apos;s what we are planning to do .
Thank you very much .
Bill Clinton : My wish : Rebuilding Rwanda
It is also unstable .
All easier said than done .
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century .
30 percent of our households gave .
Half of them gave over the Internet .
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars .
There are now a couple of hundred thousand .
He &apos;s over there .
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500 .
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars .
We negotiated it down to 190 .
We just reorganized the markets .
We need a movie on those six categories .
So we &apos;re trying to do that .
But the money is there to reach others .
The systems are not there to reach the people .
And so we have set about doing that .
Now , we started working together 18 months ago .
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five .
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent .
That &apos;s lower than the figure in the United States .
That &apos;s about 43 percent of all the pregnancies .
We &apos;ve started the first malaria treatment programs they &apos;ve ever had there .
Thank you and God bless you .
Chade-Meng Tan : Everyday compassion at Google
So what does the happiest man in the world look like ?
He certainly doesn &apos;t look like me .
He looks like this .
His name is Matthieu Ricard .
Perhaps something very naughty .
Actually , he was meditating on compassion .
Compassion is something that creates happiness .
Compassion is fun .
And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game .
But fun is not enough .
What if compassion is also profitable ?
Fortunately , I didn &apos;t have to look very far .
Google is a company born of idealism .
It &apos;s a company that thrives on idealism .
It &apos;s sort of a funny pattern .
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official .
And let me give you some examples .
So what do they do ?
There are also real business benefits .
So what are they ?
What does that mean ?
There are three components of compassion .
There is the cognitive component , which is , &quot; I understand you . &quot;
And this is the first compelling business benefit .
Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good .
It makes us a highly effective company .
In our experience , there are three ingredients .
That &apos;s one .
The second ingredient is autonomy .
So in Google , there &apos;s a lot of autonomy .
It &apos;s less naughty than it sounds .
What a company .
So &quot; Search Inside Yourself &quot; -- how does it work ?
It works in three steps .
The first step is attention training .
And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence .
The second step follows the first step .
What does that mean ?
I want you to be happy . &quot;
Imagine you can do that .
If you want to be happy , practice compassion . &quot;
Thank you .
Stephen Lawler : Tour Microsoft &apos;s Virtual Earth
What does this all mean for us ?
But we want to use our brain !
We want to navigate , explore , discover information .
In addition , it &apos;s multi-spectral .
We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air .
. So they &apos;ve got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here .
Extract geometry from the images .
This process is a very calculated process .
In fact , it was always done manual .
We think about the user interface .
What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives ?
The freshness , the capacity . I can turn this image .
I thank you very much for your time .
Allan Jones : A map of the brain
So let &apos;s take a look at the brain .
This is the blood vessels .
On the side here , this is temporal cortex .
But there &apos;s actually a lot of structure there .
So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex .
They &apos;re probably less cell dense .
So there &apos;s about 86 billion neurons in our brain .
So let &apos;s take a deeper look .
Let &apos;s look at neurons .
These are support cells -- astrocytes glia .
They &apos;re storing it , they &apos;re processing it .
And each neuron itself is largely unique .
These are proteins .
We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes .
They &apos;re encoded in the DNA .
So in order to undertake such a project , we obviously need brains .
So we sent our lab technician out .
We were seeking normal human brains .
This a place where the dead are brought in .
We are seeking normal human brains .
This is magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI .
So we collect this MR.
And then what we get is our first mapping .
And remember , it &apos;s frozen .
We take a microscope slide .
This is a more detailed map .
So the technician takes the instructions .
They scribe along a place there .
And then the laser actually cuts .
We &apos;re taking over a thousand samples for each brain .
This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus .
It &apos;s involved in learning and memory .
We &apos;ve done right now two human brains-worth of data .
So here &apos;s the modalities that we put together .
Here &apos;s the MR. It provides the framework .
And each gene gives us a fingerprint .
Now remember , we &apos;re assaying genes .
Genes send the instructions to make proteins .
Proteins are targets for drugs .
So now we can look throughout the brain .
We can see this unique fingerprint .
And we get confirmation .
It &apos;s as interesting a side effect as it could be .
We &apos;re similar at the genetic level .
And those genes are interesting , but they &apos;re very subtle .
Now what do those differences look like ?
Those kinds of studies require much larger populations .
We &apos;re certainly going to be looking at more .
This is the new frontier , if you will .
Thanks .
Rose George : Inside the secret shipping industry
It chose Somali piracy .
It wouldn &apos;t happen .
So I started to get intrigued .
But shipping isn &apos;t that .
Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been .
We are more dependent on it now than ever .
&#91; $ 60.2 billion &#93; Now why is this ?
Nothing to see , move along .
And it was a revelation .
Now that &apos;s because shipping is very efficient .
Containerization has made it very efficient .
Ships have automation now .
They can operate with small crews .
They don &apos;t have time to relax .
So that was a normal working ship .
Now how is that possible ?
And that was a surprise to me .
We were no longer allowed on deck .
There were double pirate watches .
There are interesting initiatives going on .
But why has it taken so long ?
I &apos;d really loved being on board Kendal .
Thank you .
Crazy , I know . Insane .
Thank you .
I was very limited by my condition , physically .
This meant making trade-offs .
I come from Colorado .
Mine was 146 .
If you run out of medicine , you definitely die .
No one wants to go on Flolan .
Then in February of 2008 , my grandfather passed away .
My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant .
I didn &apos;t .
I wanted to live .
He said , &quot; Be happy .
A happy patient is a healthy patient . &quot;
And it was right-heart failure .
It was my doctor in Cleveland , Marie Budev .
And they had lungs .
It was a match .
They were from Texas .
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world .
They left my chest open for two weeks .
An infection ravaged my skin .
He said it would kill me .
One year ago to this very day , I woke up .
I was 95 lbs .
It &apos;s about living .
Medical conditions don &apos;t negate the human condition .
And I &apos;m so grateful they did .
And some of us might even sing .
&#91; Singing : French &#93; Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Thank you .
Bill Stone : I &apos;m going to the moon . Who &apos;s with me ?
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places .
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico .
This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle .
To experience it is a privilege .
Bill Stone : That was taken in Wakulla Springs , Florida .
This is Europa .
Now we have to get through the ice .
You need a melt probe .
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep .
This is part of DEPTHX &apos;s mission .
There are two primary targets we &apos;re doing here .
No hands at the wheel .
DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball .
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately .
Go , go , go .
It &apos;s not going to look like that .
There is a place where you can .
We can &apos;t do that right now .
We have to beat that .
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit .
We can go much further .
There &apos;s another thing .
You got two choices .
It has never been done .
This is not like that . I &apos;m much more like Scotty .
That &apos;s not true .
I intend to lead that expedition .
We have collectively forgotten that lesson .
Thank you .
Allison Hunt : How to get hip
No , you can &apos;t start the three minutes .
Reset the three minutes , that &apos;s just not fair .
AH : Oh my God , it &apos;s harsh up here .
I mean I &apos;m nervous enough as it is .
But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago .
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery .
Do you know that surgery ?
Just two things .
That means we get our new hips for free .
So my hip had been hurting me for years .
I finally went to the doctor , which was free .
That is what free gets you .
18 more months .
I would not have my new hip for TED2008 .
I would still be on my bad hip . That was so disappointing .
Oh yeah .
We do not think that way .
&quot; Great ! Excellent ! &quot;
No , no . Front of the line .
And I saw a sign .
Well , they signed me up immediately .
Yeah . They needed some young blood .
I worked alone .
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop .
It &apos;s gonna be so great when the pain stops . Ow ! &quot;
So , naturally , I had my vest and my identification .
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor &apos;s office .
Two reasons .
First of all , I am going to take such good care of this new hip .
Derek Sivers : Weird , or just different ?
This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot;
You say , &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
And they say , &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
Blocks have names .
He said , &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot;
The second house ever built is house number two .
And this map is also accurate .
Domo arigato gozaimashita .
Nina Tandon : Caring for engineered tissue
Good morning everybody .
Why do I do this ?
What does that even mean ?
Let &apos;s take the example of the heart , What makes the heart unique ?
Well , the heart beats , rhythmically , tirelessly , faithfully .
What else do we know about the heart ?
Well , heart cells are pretty greedy .
Let &apos;s take the example of electrical stimulation .
It &apos;s about the size of a mini marshmallow .
And after one week , it &apos;s beating .
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner .
But don &apos;t worry if you can &apos;t see it so well .
It &apos;s amazing that these cells beat at all .
What does this mean for us ?
Let &apos;s do something really simple .
Thank you .
Matt Mills : Image recognition that triggers augmented reality
So let me start with this .
Then connect the power . Finally , the yellow ethernet cable .
Congratulations . You have now completed setup .
MM : Awesome . Thank you .
They &apos;re not very animated .
Tamara , would you like to jump in ?
MM : I should leap in .
What &apos;s great about this is , the tools to do this are free .
TV .
Oh my God .
Oh , that is so cool .
Oh my God ! How did you do that ?
Second child : It &apos;s magic .
MM : So , it &apos;s not magic .
Tamara , are you recording ?
Okay , so are you all ready ?
One , two , three . Go !
Audience : Whooooooo !
MM : Fellows are really good at that .
We &apos;re all very , very familiar with the Internet .
It &apos;s completely free to download this application .
Oh , there we are . We can save it now .
Tamara Roukaerts : We &apos;re ready to go .
MM on One , two , three . Go !
MM : Well done . We &apos;ve been Aurasma . Thank you .
Paul Gilding : The Earth is full
Here they are : The Earth is full .
But that &apos;s not possible , you might think .
We can &apos;t stop economic growth .
It will stop because of the end of trade resources .
Come on , you &apos;re thinking .
That &apos;s not possible .
Technology is amazing . People are innovative .
We can surely sort this out .
That &apos;s all true .
Well , it &apos;s mostly true .
The problem is we &apos;re just warming up this growth engine .
China plans to be there in just 20 years .
The only problem with this plan is that it &apos;s not possible .
We need it to develop technology .
We need it to keep social stability .
It &apos;s like the Earth doesn &apos;t care what we need .
It certainly is .
And that &apos;s what will happen to us .
If it &apos;s that bad , we &apos;ll react .
Let &apos;s just think through that idea .
Now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
We &apos;ve had science proving the urgency of change .
We &apos;re not even slowing down .
I actually don &apos;t say this in despair .
I &apos;ve done my grieving about the loss .
I accept where we are .
It is sad , but it is what it is .
So when does this transition begin ?
When does this breakdown begin ?
In my view , it is well underway .
I want to talk to you about fear .
The crisis is now inevitable .
This issue is , how will we react ?
Of course , we can &apos;t know what will happen .
The future is inherently uncertain .
Perhaps denial .
Perhaps anger .
Maybe fear .
Think about war .
And the good news , this one &apos;s a monster .
We can do it at an affordable cost .
We can do it with existing political structures .
And this is where you come in .
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating .
We need to accept the fear and then we need to act .
We need to act like the future depends on it .
We need to act like we only have one planet .
We can do this .
They &apos;re wrong .
We can be more , we can be much more .
We can choose life over fear .
This could be our finest hour .
Thank you .
Markus Fischer : A robot that flies like a bird
It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird .
Birds are very agile .
So we bring a team together .
So be careful later on .
So why do we do all this ?
So maybe we &apos;ll try it once -- to fly a SmartBird .
Thank you .
So we can now look at the SmartBird .
So here is one without a skin .
We have a wingspan of about two meters .
And it is all out of carbon fiber .
And if we now beat up and down ...
we have the possibility to fly like a bird .
We have to turn it , go up and go down .
We have a split wing .
Thank you .
Markus Fischer : Yeah , sure .
Geoffrey West : The surprising math of cities and corporations
Cities are the crucible of civilization .
That &apos;s where all these problems come from .
Here &apos;s some numbers .
This is going to affect everything .
So we have this kind of dual nature .
Now these are my comrades in arms .
That &apos;s the question .
That &apos;s the quest .
Is that conceivable ?
Are there universal laws ?
Is London a great big whale ?
Is Edinburgh a horse ?
Is Microsoft a great big anthill ?
What do we learn from that ?
Very few cities fail .
All companies die , all companies .
Well we understand this very well .
We &apos;re going to discuss that in a moment more .
That &apos;s called growth .
Here &apos;s how you grew .
Rat , that &apos;s a rat -- could have been you .
We &apos;re all pretty much the same .
You grow very quickly and then you stop .
This is just the weight versus the age .
And you see , it stops growing .
This is what we believe .
Okay , so how do we understand this ?
So let &apos;s first talk about biology .
Something else is going on .
And here &apos;s the point of that .
There is an extraordinary regularity .
And the reason for this is because of networks .
And you &apos;re very familiar with these networks .
That &apos;s a little thing that lives inside an elephant .
Don &apos;t know . We will discuss that .
Here &apos;s just a symbolic picture of that .
There is a scaling .
The slope of that is less than linear .
There is an economy of scale .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
And here , they &apos;re all plotted together .
And here &apos;s the statement .
What is the reason for this ?
So there it is , I &apos;ve said it again .
On the left is the heart rate showing biology .
Lastly , I want to talk about growth .
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis .
See companies , they scale .
The top one , in fact , is Walmart on the right .
It &apos;s the same plot .
We could use sales , anything you like .
There &apos;s Walmart . Doesn &apos;t look very sigmoidal .
That &apos;s what we like , hockey sticks .
Let &apos;s go up to 2008 .
That red line is from the theory .
There they are . That &apos;s 23,000 companies .
Thank you .
David Bismark : E-voting without fraud
Our democracies rely on elections .
Without that mandate , they would be corrupt .
The ballot boxes go to counting places .
So we have to trust a lot of people .
We have to trust a lot of procedures .
And sometimes we even have to trust computers .
And that &apos;s the tough part .
And the secret is the ballot form .
So this is how you vote .
And you shred the candidate list .
But the election magic doesn &apos;t stop there .
Thank you .
Grégoire Courtine : The paralyzed rat that walked
I still remember this decisive moment .
These words , they stuck with me .
But how to make it happen ?
My idea : We awaken this network .
He listened to me carefully , and responded with a grin .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you try ? &quot;
Imagine that the locomotor system is a car .
The engine is the spinal cord .
The transmission is interrupted . The engine is turned off .
How could we re-engage the engine ?
Immediately , the paralyzed rat can stand .
This was amazing .
This locomotion was completely involuntary .
Clearly , the steering system was missing .
Imagine , this is really cool .
We were so frustrated .
In fact -- Thank you .
But the remaining question was , how ?
But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area .
This is truly a trans-disciplinary team .
And me ?
Me too , every day .
The truth is that we don &apos;t know enough yet .
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury .
Thank you .
There is a real problem with snobbery .
Snobbery is a global phenomenon .
It exists . What is a snob ?
That is snobbery .
I don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
In other words -- feel sympathy , rather than contempt .
We &apos;ve done away with the caste system .
And it &apos;s a beautiful idea .
And she &apos;s got a very large house .
She &apos;s simply too strange .
She comes from an odd place .
And yet , they &apos;re not .
Which makes for a very -- can make for a very stressful situation .
In other words , what is a meritocratic society ?
Let &apos;s take meritocracy .
I am a meritocrat in that sense .
It &apos;s not the post that should count .
But something very valuable in that idea , nevertheless .
That is an unknown part of them .
There is another source of solace and comfort for all this .
They &apos;ve passed the wrong piece of legislation . Whatever it is .
And then are fit for ridicule .
Now is there any alternative to this ?
And I asked them to write the headline for the story of Othello .
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary .
And then my favorite .
We think very highly of ourselves , and so we should .
And so we tend to worship ourselves .
Our heroes are human heroes .
That &apos;s a very new situation .
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and failure .
I &apos;m always thinking , &quot; How could I be more successful ? &quot;
You can &apos;t be successful at everything .
We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance .
Nonsense . You can &apos;t have it all . You can &apos;t .
We are highly open to suggestion .
But what I really want to stress is by all means , success , yes .
Let &apos;s probe away at our notions of success .
Thank you very much .
Because otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic .
Or do you think that you can &apos;t ?
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
Alain de Botton .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;ve noticed something interesting about society and culture .
That &apos;s true in everything risky except technology .
You &apos;re supposed to learn this stuff how ?
Instead , hit the space bar .
The space bar scrolls down one page .
Hold down the Shift key to scroll back up again .
So space bar to scroll down one page .
But what about the pop-up menu where you put in your state ?
Just hit the space bar twice .
Go space , space . It is totally amazing .
Here &apos;s something that drives me crazy .
I &apos;m not bitter .
Answering machine : At the tone , please — BEEP .
I didn &apos;t say these were going to be perfect .
You don &apos;t even have to click anything .
There &apos;s the definition as you type .
Type the name of the airline and the flight .
It &apos;s also a unit and currency conversion .
It neatly selects just that word .
Much more precise . Again , don &apos;t bother deleting .
Just type over it .
You get it every time .
In the meantime , congratulations .
Have a great day .
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala : Want to help Africa ? Do business here
And sometimes I &apos;m puzzled , and I ask myself why .
This is the Africa of opportunity .
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London .
There &apos;s still a long way to go , but that there &apos;s a will there .
That is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform .
I want to tell you that .
We -- as a result , we decided to liberalize many of our markets .
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury .
So the market is there .
When they crashed , we crashed .
And that shores up our economy , makes it stable .
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent .
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
We have opportunities in agriculture , like I said .
We have opportunities in housing and real estate .
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million .
We are doing the same with the insurance sector .
So in financial services , a great deal of opportunity .
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries .
So it &apos;s clear that things are changing .
It says , &quot; Africa : Open for Business . &quot;
For 10,000 pieces .
Nobody thinks there &apos;s opportunity .
So I invite you to explore the opportunities .
Thank you very much .
Bobby Ghosh : Why global jihad is losing
I &apos;m going to talk about the power of a word : jihad .
We didn &apos;t know any better . We didn &apos;t pause to ask .
Do you hate Americans ?
That was the power of that word that he was able to do .
The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling .
What does that mean for us in the West ?
They use his rhetoric .
They &apos;re fighting battles over much narrower issues .
It &apos;s old school al Qaeda .
You may remember these guys .
But they have been distracted recently .
The good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be .
We know how to fight it now .
Who ended the global jihad ?
We don &apos;t have to reinvent the wheel .
We don &apos;t have to go back to that .
We &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
His definition of jihad can now be expunged .
Thank you .
Kenichi Ebina : My magic moves
&quot; Mars et Avril &quot; is a science fiction film .
It &apos;s set in Montreal some 50 years in the future .
How did I do this ?
Well , it &apos;s two things . First , it &apos;s time .
The second aspect is love .
But let me go back in time a bit .
And I just love this guy .
His career I admire a lot .
Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet .
But that &apos;s kind of a big problem .
They are objects of desire .
They are imaginary musical instruments .
And they carry a nice story with them .
So that &apos;s kind of a big problem too .
He took a leap of faith .
So here they are .
I have experienced it .
Thank you .
The record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive .
Why has the record been so poor ?
The first principle is : it &apos;s the politics that matters .
So , the first thing that is prioritized is politics .
Try and build a political settlement first .
So , short-term peacekeepers .
It &apos;s an election .
So that &apos;s the conventional approach .
We see that there is no quick fix .
There &apos;s certainly no quick security fix .
And the risks stay high throughout the decade .
And the loser is unreconciled .
The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence .
Why does the politics get easier ?
And why is it so difficult initially ?
And in order to build prosperity , we need security in place .
But the objective of facing reality is to change reality .
The first actor is the Security Council .
It is a cost-effective approach .
It does increase security .
But it needs to be done long-term .
That &apos;s one actor , the Security Council .
The donors provide post-conflict aid .
They moved on to some other situation .
Post-conflict economic recovery is a slow process .
There are no quick processes in economics except decline .
You can do that quite fast .
And there are two key things it &apos;s got to do .
It &apos;s got to reform economic policy .
Why ? Because during conflict economic policy typically deteriorates .
The inclusion agenda doesn &apos;t come from elections .
So those three actors .
And they are interdependent over a long term .
And so we need a post-conflict compact .
So that &apos;s idea one : recognize interdependence .
And that is to focus on a few critical objectives .
One is jobs .
So jobs , health , and clean government .
Those are the three critical priorities .
So I &apos;m going to talk a little about each of them .
Jobs .
And why are jobs so important ?
Jobs for whom ? Especially jobs for young men .
It &apos;s because young men get upset .
Now , that is difficult .
That is not a good idea .
It &apos;s not sustainable .
But typically that sector has withered away during conflict .
During conflict people are doing destruction .
What might the bottlenecks be ?
First you need access to land .
We need firms . The firms have gone away .
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms .
Neither of those approaches is sensible .
They want to have the discipline and accountability .
So , jobs , basic services , finally , clean government .
Clean means follow their money .
So that &apos;s the -- let me wrap up , this is the package .
What &apos;s the goal ?
So that &apos;s the focus on the construction sector .
Where would that leave us ?
George Whitesides : Toward a science of simplicity
The trouble is , I don &apos;t .
The quote is from the fabled Potter Stewart opinion on pornography .
But I know it when I see it . &quot;
I &apos;m going to come back to that in a moment .
So , what is simplicity ?
It &apos;s good to start with some examples .
Why is that important ?
Well , it enables you to drink coffee .
And the two here are just examples .
One is the cellphone , which we use every day .
The teapot problem I &apos;ll pose this way .
And that &apos;s a simple question .
It &apos;s like , what is simplicity ?
All of these are possibilities .
What is the state of science ?
And , interestingly , complexity is very highly evolved .
The components interact with one another .
And it &apos;s like the traffic that you see .
And let me reduce this to the simplest level .
We &apos;ve heard from Bill Gates recently .
That &apos;s a Bono , this is a Bono .
The answer is , not a lot .
And that &apos;s complexity .
The Internet starts with mathematics , it starts with binary .
In binary , one is 0001 , seven is 0111 .
Anything else is more complicated .
They can be on and off . That &apos;s binary .
Now wall switches , we all know , fail .
With integrated circuits , you can build cellphones .
And from that comes the Internet .
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent .
The two blobs that are light in the middle there are the United States and Europe .
And then back to simplicity again .
Their behavior is predictable .
So , for example , stones .
That is , you can stack them .
It just is not possible .
So these are the components .
So , how does one do that ?
It &apos;s a little paper chip .
It wicks its way up into these little branches .
You know , no power required .
So you can &apos;t make it too simple .
This is by de Saint-Exupery .
And that certainly is going in the right direction .
Thank you very much .
Quick question .
Have you started to do that ?
GW : Well , no .
How do I put that simply ? No .
That was a simple , powerful answer . GW : Yes .
You &apos;ve got a company set up to ...
GW : A foundation , a foundation . Not-for-profit .
Now I &apos;m going to start with a deceptively simple example .
So what &apos;s happening here ?
I call this &quot; groundswell collaborative consumption . &quot;
They &apos;re growing up sharing -- files , video games , knowledge .
It &apos;s second nature to them .
So all of this is a lot of twittering , right ?
Three , pressing unresolved environmental concerns .
The first is redistribution markets .
The second is collaborative lifestyles .
It &apos;s a scheme in the U.K.
Together they grow their own food .
Now , the third system is product-service systems .
It &apos;s kind of ridiculous , right ?
This represents an eight-year time span .
But now with the Web , we leave a trail .
Let &apos;s go back to my first example , Swaptree .
Thank you very much .
Malcolm London : &quot; High School Training Ground &quot;
This is a training ground .
Social lines are barbed wire .
Labels like &quot; Regulars &quot; and &quot; Honors &quot; resonate .
The need for degrees has left so many people frozen .
You actually put action to the issues you care about .
So , how do you do that ?
You can send them an email .
It doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s spam .
How about you get on the phone ?
That doesn &apos;t move .
So what actually works ?
And the answer is rather strange .
It &apos;s a letter .
Letters actually work .
So , how are you going to write your letter ?
First of all , you &apos;re going to pick up an analog device : a pen .
They don &apos;t spend a lot of time dicking around .
So , here you go .
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere .
&quot; Obviously , you &apos;re intelligent .
Lastly , you want to be the nurturing agent .
You &apos;re the safe place to come in to .
You &apos;re going to do that by the way you sign your letter .
Why is is this important ?
Here &apos;s how you mail your letter .
First of all , you send the original to the district office .
So , you send the copy to the main office .
Get writing .
Damian Palin : Mining minerals from seawater
I collaborate with bacteria .
And this attracts metals from their local environment .
And the desalination process is one where we take out salts .
We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure .
And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane .
Thank you .
Drew Dudley : Everyday leadership
We &apos;ve made into something beyond us .
We &apos;ve made it about changing the world .
&quot; It was awesome .
This girl right here knows exactly what I &apos;m talking about .
He just kind of held the lollipop out like this . &quot;
And she walks away , and I &apos;m flattened .
I &apos;m still dating that guy four years later . &quot;
Here &apos;s the kicker . I don &apos;t remember that .
And my call to action today is that we need to get over that .
There &apos;s so many of you .
But that &apos;s what we were told .
Stand up for yourself .
Geek . Fatty . Slut . Fag .
We were kids .
Now , not so much .
When I was 11 , I wanted to be left alone .
I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to be a writer . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Choose something realistic . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Professional wrestler . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Don &apos;t be stupid . &quot;
And I wasn &apos;t the only one .
My dreams are self-conscious and overly apologetic .
See , my dreams got called names too .
Silly . Foolish . Impossible .
But I kept dreaming .
I was going to be The Garbage Man .
My finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor .
Poetry .
Standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embracing violence .
I gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise .
This is who I am .
This is how I stand up for myself .
I thought they were both pork chops .
Not really a big deal .
I saw no reason to lie .
As far as I was concerned , life was pretty good .
To this day , I hate pork chops .
But the school halls were a battleground .
To this day , kids are still being called names .
The classics were , &quot; Hey stupid , &quot; &quot; Hey spaz . &quot;
You signed it , &quot; They were wrong . &quot;
You have to believe that they were wrong .
They have to be wrong .
Why else would we still be here ?
We only got out to walk and get gas .
Of course they did .
Quads have been around for a long time .
So , how did it just do that ?
The bulk of our research is algorithms .
For example , that &apos;s how we can make the quad hover .
Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach .
Balancing a pole is hard .
Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry ?
Will the vaulter stick the landing ?
There simply isn &apos;t enough time .
Interaction doesn &apos;t have to be virtual . It can be physical .
Take this quad , for example .
We can change this behavior , however .
Let &apos;s have a little bit of fun with this .
Okay , here goes .
Whew !
Thank you .
Because we are all patients , we are all people .
Even doctors are patients at some point .
It goes all the way back to Aristotle .
And doctors hate it , right ?
Not a lot of cool , sexy stuff happening in dentistry .
People brush and floss their teeth .
They had a big patient population .
They divided them up into two groups .
So that was the low-fear group .
They showed bloody gums .
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth .
So go brush and floss your teeth .
That was the message . That was the experiment .
Now they measured one other variable .
So the upshot was this .
It was the sense of efficacy .
It &apos;s an amazing notion .
We don &apos;t really know how to manipulate it , though , that well .
Except , maybe we do .
And I don &apos;t know if it works .
So let me just spool it out a little bit .
But it actually hits home .
Finally , we need to be presented with a clear point of action .
The choice in this case is pretty simple .
We should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent .
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
It &apos;s very difficult to line things up so neatly .
But we have an opportunity .
This is a pharmaceutical ad .
But it looks completely right .
Because we know .
There is no good faith in this .
So this is a different approach .
So let me just walk through this quickly .
You can understand exactly what the benefits are .
And finally , you understand what those choices are .
And so I came up with this : lab test results .
Blood test results are this great source of information .
They &apos;re packed with information .
They go right to doctors .
This is the worst presented information .
So that &apos;s what I want to walk you through .
This is our one-page summary .
We use the notion of color .
It &apos;s an amazing notion that color could be used .
We tell you that you &apos;re okay , you &apos;re normal .
So that &apos;s our general blood work test .
Then we went to CRP test .
In this case , it &apos;s a sin of omission .
Then we use the information that &apos;s already in the lab report .
The last one I &apos;ll show you is a PSA test .
And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that .
We again personalized the risks .
In this case it &apos;s about 25 percent , based on that .
And then again , the follow-up actions .
So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars , all right .
Why is Wired magazine doing this ?
It should be the patient .
This is information that is incredibly powerful .
It &apos;s an incredibly powerful catalyst to change .
But we &apos;re not using it . It &apos;s just sitting there .
It &apos;s being lost .
But you can create your own feedback loop .
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes .
What are my options ? What choices are now on the table ?
And then , what &apos;s next ?
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people .
And this information is out there .
Thank you very much .
But one thing is clear .
So the era of big infrastructure is over .
We need new tools and new approaches .
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself .
So we really had a lot to deal with .
And the idea has two core stages .
Many , many species depend on them .
How does the reef work ? Well , it &apos;s very , very simple .
What is fuzzy rope , you ask ?
So get your Tevas on .
So the water is churned through this raft .
And then those spat are then seeded .
New word .
I get asked two questions about this project .
One is : why isn &apos;t it happening now ?
And the answer is : not yet , they &apos;re working .
Thank you .
What did it mean that he was dead ?
Where had he gone ?
And that &apos;s frightening . It &apos;s terrifying .
And so we look for a way out .
Now this didn &apos;t sound very plausible .
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all .
It has been demonstrated in over 400 empirical studies .
Now these studies are ingenious , but they &apos;re simple .
They work like this .
Now , one group was asked to think about being dead .
The other group was asked to think about being lonely .
They were then asked again about their religious beliefs .
Twice as likely .
Even though the before they were all equally agnostic .
This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history .
Now , the first story is the simplest .
In other words , I can do what Jesus did .
I want to live on in my apartment . &quot;
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could .
And so it should be with us .
Thank you .
Richard Resnick : Welcome to the genomic revolution
Chromosome one , top left .
Bottom right are the sex chromosomes .
How many are there in the human genome ? Three billion .
Is that a big number ?
Well , everybody can throw around big numbers .
So it &apos;s really quite big .
It &apos;s called the Beijing Genomics Institute .
What does this mean for medicine ?
So a woman is age 37 .
She is treated with surgery , chemotherapy and radiation .
She goes home .
Significant problems remained .
But the gene that regulates that down is broken .
Today , it &apos;s here .
None , not one .
But ultimately , it was a disruption on top of a disruption .
Look , this is where we are today .
So I just recently had to buy life insurance .
But what would have happened if I had said C ?
Consumer applications for genomics , they will flourish .
Personalized genomic massage anyone ?
And it looks really good .
Do you think that &apos;s not going to happen ?
Do you think it would have helped John McCain ?
Anybody ? Nobody .
Typically , there &apos;s one or two .
They all hated each other .
Now this is probably a good thing , right ?
You have bigger clan gatherings and so on .
But maybe it &apos;s a bad thing as well .
Thank you .
Alain de Botton : Atheism 2.0
Now I think it &apos;s too easy .
Now what is Atheism 2.0 ?
I can &apos;t believe in the doctrines .
I don &apos;t think these doctrines are right .
I really like the art of Mantegna .
I really like looking at old churches .
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament . &quot;
So that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .
I don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
I think there is an alternative .
The secular world is full of holes .
We have secularized badly , I would argue .
I &apos;d like to kick off by looking at education .
That &apos;s a lovely idea .
Interesting where it came from .
They asked themselves the following question .
They said culture .
They wanted to replace scripture with culture .
And that &apos;s a very plausible idea .
It &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
Why ? They don &apos;t think we need it .
They see us as adults , rational adults .
What we need is information .
We need data , we don &apos;t need help .
Now religions start from a very different place indeed .
We &apos;re only just holding it together .
Perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
But anyway , we &apos;re only just holding it together .
And we need help . Of course , we need help .
Now we &apos;ve given up with the idea of sermons .
I &apos;m an independent , individual person . &quot;
Religions go , &quot; Nonsense .
So get on your knees and repeat it . &quot;
We associate repetition with boredom .
&quot; Give us the new , &quot; we &apos;re always saying .
&quot; The new is better than the old . &quot;
The other things that religions do is to arrange time .
All the major religions give us calendars .
What is a calendar ?
Now we don &apos;t think that way .
I &apos;ll just come across it . &quot;
Nonsense , says the religious world view .
Take the Moon . It &apos;s really important to look at the Moon .
You &apos;ll be handed rice cakes .
That &apos;s very good .
But the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
And you would go , &quot; Amen , amen , amen . &quot;
They tell us to have a bath .
We don &apos;t tend to do that .
Let &apos;s look at art now .
You &apos;ve heard that saying .
I couldn &apos;t disagree more .
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
And that &apos;s what art is .
Essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view .
Now the word &quot; propaganda &quot; sets off alarm bells .
Art should be didactic .
Let &apos;s think of something else .
And they tend to be on their own .
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own .
And they don &apos;t really change much .
What do organized religions do ?
They group together , they form institutions .
And that has all sorts of advantages .
First of all , scale , might .
These are massive machines .
These are all very good qualities .
They &apos;re selling us shoes and cars .
We need to group together .
And that &apos;s what religions do .
That &apos;s something we can learn from .
I want to conclude .
Look very closely at pilgrimage .
Thank you very much .
You can get shot by both sides .
Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment .
Indeed .
Actually , let me just ask a question .
One wants to say , &quot; Nonsense . Why not ? &quot;
There &apos;s so much we can absorb .
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
It &apos;s seen as hypocrisy .
You move on .
They &apos;ve ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement .
It doesn &apos;t need it .
I &apos;ve sketched a sort of broad framework .
So it &apos;s a wiki project .
I like special missions and secret objectives .
Now , 21 billion hours , it &apos;s a lot of time .
Now , I want to take this problem seriously .
I wish I &apos;d stayed in touch with my friends .
And we &apos;re going to come back to this one .
Really wanting to die .
Now , why a game ?
This was an easier way to ask for help .
We also collected and activated power-ups .
Well , it turns out there &apos;s some science here too .
I feel closer to my friends and family .
Now , does this sound familiar ?
Now this is interesting , right ?
But how does it work ?
That would be good , right ?
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;re going to play a quick game together .
Very good .
That &apos;s all it takes .
Everybody ready for your next quest ?
Go !
Don &apos;t give up .
Bonus physical resilience . Well done , everyone .
It gets stronger the more you exercise it .
So good job . Quest number three .
So , what do we want to see ?
Got that ?
Okay , one more . Baby elephant .
We &apos;re clapping for that ?
That &apos;s amazing .
And this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio .
Looking good , looking good .
Nice , nice .
Keep it up . I love it !
Touch is even better .
So this is true .
Yeah ! Awesome .
Wait , wait , wait .
Well , here &apos;s my suggestion .
Pretty clever , right ?
Thank you .
Caroline Phillips : Hurdy-gurdy for beginners
And in Spanish , &quot; zanfona . &quot;
And in Italian , &quot; ghironda , &quot; okay ?
Hurdy-gurdy , or wheel fiddle .
So , these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy .
It has three different kinds of strings .
And the third string is pretty innovative .
It activates what &apos;s called the buzzing bridge , or the dog .
And it &apos;s very difficult to tune .
CP : Okay .
There I go .
&#91; Basque &#93; Thank you .
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel .
Thank you . Thank you .
Lauren Zalaznick : The conscience of television
So most everyone watches TV .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
Here in America , people actually love TV .
Okay ?
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
They , in fact , berate it .
We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness .
We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
We feel awe , we feel pity .
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
We love to watch TV .
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
What did this mean for you ?
Okay , here we go .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
Moral ambiguity starts to climb .
Why ?
Look what happens .
In 1970 , inspiration plummets .
It &apos;s trying to recover .
Take a look at this .
This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
This is rising . Comfort stays whole .
Irreverence starts to rise .
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
You get to 1969 , and look what happens .
What &apos;s number one ?
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Viewers had responded dramatically .
That &apos;s what we mean by a breakout show .
In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
Now look at this .
The 70s means who ? Norman Lear .
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
What were those shows ?
Glamorous and rich .
&quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fantasy Island . &quot;
Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
But look : X marks the spot .
Why not ?
We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
We had 9 / 11 .
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
Look what happens when we keep going .
I would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
No , they want judgment .
I can vote you off the island .
I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
So thanks very much .
Ze Frank : Nerdcore comedy
It &apos;s such a large conference .
And two -- I want to pick the theme for TED 2006 .
I invented the Placebo Camera .
Sincerely , Mister Michael Bangoora . &quot;
This is really embarrassing .
I only prepared 15 .
I &apos;m really sorry .
What &apos;s your name ?
Mark Serfaas . It &apos;s pretty cool , huh ? Pursuing happiness .
Are you a virgin ? Virgin ?
You don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about ?
Ah , Mark -- Serfaas .
1,860 -- am I good ?
And that &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
That &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
Yeah , I was hanging out with some Google guys last night .
Really cool , we were getting wasted .
Am I feeling lucky ?
Am I feeling lucky ?
Audience : Yes .
Ze Frank : Oh . Amazing .
For example , somebody wrote me .
And that was embarrassing .
You can do heckler mode .
Voice : Hey , moron , get off the stage .
ZF : You get off the stage .
Voice : We want Malcolm Gladwell .
In case you run over time .
And frog mode .
I came up with a few games .
This is called &quot; Atheist . &quot;
Look , I &apos;ll move around and say some things .
So that didn &apos;t go over so well .
I don &apos;t really understand why you &apos;re laughing .
But you come back as a duck .
It &apos;s the third in the series .
Do you have a preference ? Good choice .
I think they &apos;re wonderful .
So , the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .
In other words , it &apos;s a helping tool .
Darling . Beautiful stuff .
These are haikus .
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr. Ze Frank .
Yann Dall &apos;Aglio : Love -- you &apos;re doing it wrong
What is love ?
I can love jogging .
I can love a book , a movie .
I can love escalopes .
I can love my wife .
This phenomenon is modernity .
Now it is quoted in the stock exchange .
Hence the anxiety of contemporary man .
How many people are going to love me ? &quot;
Well , by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability .
Consumerism is not materialism .
So they are artists of picking up chicks .
And they call heartache &quot; one-itis . &quot;
But such a future doesn &apos;t have to be .
Another path to thinking about love may be possible .
But how ?
How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued ?
Well , by becoming aware of my uselessness .
Yes , I &apos;m useless .
But rest assured : so are you .
We are all useless .
I don &apos;t have any inherent value .
What is tenderness ?
To be tender is to accept the loved one &apos;s weaknesses .
It &apos;s not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies .
That &apos;s pretty bad .
On the contrary , there &apos;s plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness .
I refer to self-mockery .
Bjarke Ingels : 3 warp-speed architecture tales
He triggered the modernist revolution .
Only the best ones can survive .
It doesn &apos;t really work in this context .
You never know when you might need it .
And we saw this guy , Haibao .
We even double checked .
So the People &apos;s Building , as we called it .
This is our two interpreters , sort of reading the architecture .
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him .
Sustainability .
China symbolized by the dragon .
Copenhagen , Shanghai , modern , European .
Bicycles have become forbidden many places .
A third of all the people commute by bike .
We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai .
You can try it .
So we can actually hitch a ride for free .
The first thing , the China map missed Taiwan .
This is my apartment .
The house is sort of a distortion of a square block .
This is our first architectural model .
And essentially , the apartments cover the parking .
They can actually have both .
So we took the commission .
We quite often make little movies .
It has no water . It has no energy , no resources .
They create shelter from the wind .
They accumulate the solar energy .
They accumulate the water .
Yes , maybe just to round off .
Thank you .
Joseph Lekuton : A parable for Kenya
My name is Joseph , a Member of Parliament in Kenya .
I had never in my life ever tasted candy .
My family moved ; we &apos;re nomads .
Fifty miles , 40 miles , it doesn &apos;t matter .
And there was this specific tribe that was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe .
But these two people worked something out .
And that man told me , &quot; So , here you are .
We &apos;ll walk you , you lead us . &quot;
So I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to dedicate myself .
I &apos;m leaving America . I &apos;m going to run for office . &quot;
We &apos;re building dispensaries across that constituency .
I &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
Thank you very much .
Liz Diller : A new museum wing ... in a giant bubble
But we &apos;re less attuned to the nuances of the public .
And we &apos;re doing this through some case studies .
It really goes beyond distinction .
Now we &apos;re moving onto Washington , D.C.
The Mall is a symbol of American democracy .
It may just be a place for civic commiseration .
There are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
There are over 500 think tanks .
There should be some kind of brain trust .
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum .
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference .
It would have the informality of the town square .
Architects love to hate it .
And around that space , the ring is actually galleries .
Very , very difficult to mount shows in there .
Where would it go ?
It can &apos;t go in the Mall .
There is no space there .
It can &apos;t go in the courtyard .
It &apos;s already taken up by landscape and by sculptures .
Well there &apos;s always the hole .
How could it become iconic ?
And what language would it take ?
The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall &apos;s momumental institutions .
It has to be different from the buildings there .
It has to be something entirely different .
It has to be air .
In our imagination , it has to be light .
And it has to be free .
So this is the big idea .
It &apos;s a giant airbag .
The before and the after .
It was dubbed &quot; the bubble &quot; by the press .
That was the lounge .
The membrane is translucent .
It &apos;s made of silcon-coated glass fiber .
This is the view from the inside .
It had to be approved by actually two agencies .
It is yours to interpret .
There was also some creative interpretation involved .
And the bubble is 153 ft .
That &apos;s the Pantheon next to it .
It &apos;s about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air .
And so we couldn &apos;t really touch its surfaces .
We couldn &apos;t leave any traces behind .
It glows from within , it &apos;s translucent .
So it &apos;s down the hierarchy on lighting .
So it comes to the site twice a year .
It &apos;s taken off the delivery truck .
It &apos;s hoisted .
And then it &apos;s inflated with this low-pressure air .
And then it &apos;s restrained with the cables .
And then it &apos;s ballasted with water at the very bottom .
And they really connected with that idea .
And then it was really easy all the way through .
But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones .
This is the warp and weft .
This is a point cloud .
There are extreme pressures .
And I &apos;m just going to zip through these slides .
And this is the space in action .
Could be used for anything , for performances , films , for installations .
Form and content are together here .
The bubble is an anti-monument .
Thank you .
And this routine went on for some time .
When I was seven I went to summer camp .
You could jump off the end into the deep end .
I was born premature . I was always very small .
My left lung had collapsed when I was born .
And I &apos;ve always had buoyancy problems .
So water was something that scared me to begin with .
But I would go in on occasion .
That is something that I did not get over .
But there is a happy ending to this story .
So , moving onward .
Swimming , first principles .
First principles , this is very important .
So the clock started ticking .
I tried kickboards .
Hand paddles , everything .
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics .
So it turns out that propulsion isn &apos;t really the problem .
The problem is hydrodynamics .
The only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
So let &apos;s look at some examples . This is Terry .
And so his entire body really is underwater .
The arm is extended below the head .
Here is an example of the stroke .
You can see this is the left extension .
Then you see his left leg .
Not their fault , honestly .
And now I love swimming . I can &apos;t wait to go swimming .
And that will get you very far .
Languages . Material versus method .
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan .
My teachers assured me , they said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry .
I arrived in Tokyo . Amazing .
You &apos;ve never seen a more confused Japanese woman .
I walked in to school .
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper .
Asked him what this said .
And so it came to me in waves .
The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes , per se .
I tried everything . I went to Kinokuniya .
I tried every possible book , every possible CD .
Nothing worked until I found this .
And this became my Holy Grail , my Rosetta Stone .
As soon as I focused on this material , I took off .
You can also do this with grammar .
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation .
And now I love languages .
So ballroom dancing , implicit versus explicit -- very important .
I used to be much bigger , much more muscular .
And so I ended up walking like this .
Not very good for ballroom dancing .
The instructor says , &quot; You are participating . &quot;
Immediately : death sweat .
She comes up , and this was her approach , the teacher .
&quot; Okay , come on , grab me . &quot;
Gorgeous assistant instructor .
So I bought a month &apos;s worth of classes .
So I had a very short deadline for a competition .
Secondly , different types of pivots .
Thirdly , variation in tempo .
I &apos;m going to jump forward here .
His name is Gabriel Misse .
Alicia , in her own right , very famous .
So he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm .
So he can lift the woman to break her , for example .
That &apos;s just one benefit of that .
So then we broke it down .
This would be an example of one pivot .
This is a back step pivot .
There are many different types .
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn &apos;t do .
Apply them to very big dreams .
I know nothing . I &apos;m a beginner .
Thank you very much .
There was gas rationing in 1973 .
The energy crisis was in full bore .
That got me very excited .
So , I started this company called Solar Devices .
And I said , &quot; No , it &apos;s a Stirling engine . It really is . &quot;
But they didn &apos;t believe me .
And my first year at Caltech , I continued the business .
First , the coursework at Caltech .
So what about making energy ?
Maybe we could make energy .
I tried to figure out -- maybe solar &apos;s become attractive .
And it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective .
So , that &apos;s a breakthrough .
I &apos;ll be very short on genetic algorithms .
And I &apos;ll show you what we came up with .
Traditionally , concentrators look like this .
Those shapes are parabolas .
And this is the shape that evolved .
Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though .
It collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day .
We needed to beat solar cells .
So we took a look at another idea .
But , his refinements were incredible .
Those were major breakthroughs .
Another type of engine is the hot air engine .
Put a flame under it , the piston moves up .
That &apos;s a heat engine .
I &apos;m still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time .
We applied the genetic algorithm .
We got the results from that for the optimal engine .
So this is the engine .
The exact converse is also true .
So now you put the two things together .
Thank you .
It doesn &apos;t really care .
and you also get hot water .
The hot water &apos;s optional .
So , we &apos;ve been working on this for the last two years .
It could be on your roof , or in your backyard , or somewhere else .
This is how we would envision a residential application .
It &apos;s a really good combination of those two factors .
So an example of that is , here &apos;s the map of the United States .
This is the map of the United States .
And of course , look at Africa .
It just makes economic sense .
Basically , oil is solar energy concentrate .
Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience .
Marc Pachter : The art of the interview
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
So , how do we do that ?
Now , I had two preconditions .
One was that they be American .
Sixties , seventies , eighties and nineties .
And why did I do that ?
There are many kinds of interviews . We know them .
Fair enough .
But I wanted interviews that were different .
By the way , this was always done in public .
This was not an oral history program .
Now , it turns out that I was pretty good at that .
I didn &apos;t know it coming into it .
And he had never appeared in public since that point .
It was about their energy .
I &apos;m convinced of it .
These were people through their 90s .
And I said , &quot; Yeah . Apparently I did . &quot;
The journalist who did &quot; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich . &quot;
Didn &apos;t matter . &quot; Whatever .
Awful .
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person .
We were on the stage and then -- by the way , spectacular .
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce &apos;s look .
She was in a great evening gown .
When we were alone , I was her audience .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m learning . &quot;
Again , a remarkable person .
And she was in horrible pain .
We all knew that .
She stayed in her room .
The usual sort of thing .
I interviewed Steve Martin . It wasn &apos;t all that long ago .
Was yours unhappy ? &quot;
Again , some of you will know him , most of you won &apos;t , Dumas Malone .
And I asked him one question .
I said , &quot; Did Jefferson ever disappoint you ? &quot;
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally .
He said , &quot; But I understand that . &quot; He said , &quot; I understand that . &quot;
This was to Agnes de Mille .
An amazing woman .
She said , &quot; Come to my apartment . &quot;
She lived in New York .
She wasn &apos;t about to make up for this occasion .
She agreed .
She came on . Of course she was wheelchaired on .
It was an amazing privilege to do this series .
Thank you very much .
The air was fetid , the room a shambles .
&apos;Thank you for coming , Steve .
Crumbling world , word , voice .
Tell the clocks to stop .
&apos;Gravity is pulling me down .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s start with the definition of schizophrenia .
Schizophrenia is a brain disease .
Its defining feature is psychosis , or being out of touch with reality .
&apos;Come to the Florida sunshine bush .
I shrugged and followed them .
&apos;We &apos;ve got to case the joint .
I never struck anyone .
There &apos;s nothing benign about it .
They &apos;re different from me and you .
The mission is not yet complete .
I think you need to be in the hospital .
You &apos;re offering to put me in hospitals ?
Hospitals are bad , they &apos;re mad , they &apos;re sad .
So would I take the pill ? In an instant .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . You &apos;re very kind .
Thank you .
The story begins in the late &apos; 90s .
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities .
Expertise has for sure had its moments .
We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane .
What kind of a world should we be making ?
What kind of a world can we be making ? &quot;
And that was only the beginning .
We are playing with fire .
So the conversation began at Bennington .
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective .
They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines .
Design , the art of organizing the world of things .
This discovery is transforming .
But it is a politics of principle , not of partisanship .
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it .
Think of it as a kind of secular church .
The words on the card describe what will happen inside .
So we are doing our job .
We actually do it all the time .
That is where you come in .
So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed ?
Well , you have two things .
You have a mind . And you have other people .
Start with those , and change the world .
Onyx Ashanti : This is beatjazz
Text : BeatJazz .
Accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
Why ?
And &quot; BeatJazzers &quot; become as common as D.J. &apos; s .
But mostly ...
to MAKE the future rather than wait for it .
Jane Fonda : Life &apos;s third act
Think about that .
That &apos;s the metaphor , the old metaphor .
Age as pathology .
How do we live it successfully ?
Age not at all as pathology ; age as potential .
And guess what ?
Some of the studies even say we &apos;re happier .
I come from a long line of depressives .
And I got scared .
I thought , oh my gosh .
I &apos;m going to become a crotchety old lady .
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being .
I don &apos;t want to romanticize aging .
Some of it is a matter of luck .
Some of it , obviously , is genetic .
One third of it , in fact , is genetic .
Myself included .
It &apos;s a terrible disease . It &apos;s fatal .
It wastes the body , but the mind remains intact .
As I diminished , I grew .
Perhaps our parents suffered from depression .
And so we can feel unfinished .
How was I supposed to live it ?
Who were my grandparents ?
How did they treat my parents ?
These kinds of things .
You &apos;re able to free yourself from your past .
It &apos;s like resetting a thermostat .
Women start off whole , don &apos;t we ?
We have agency .
We are the subjects of our own lives .
Older women are the largest demographic in the world .
Thank you very much .
Kartick Satyanarayan : How we rescued the &quot; dancing &quot; bears &quot;
And we went in , pretending to be buyers .
And we found this right in this very state , in Karnataka .
The couple are barely 18 years old .
It was unacceptable .
The mother bears are usually killed .
So , this is Bitu Qalandar , who was our first experiment .
And we were so unsure that this would work .
And now he sells cool drinks , he &apos;s by the highway .
He has a telephone booth .
We gave cycle rickshaws .
Education . The kids never went to school .
So , we sponsor 600 children education programs today .
Of course we also had to get the bears in .
And this is what we turn them into .
We rescued over 550 dancing bears .
And the people can hold their heads up high .
Marla Spivak : Why bees are disappearing
They &apos;re out there because they need to eat .
Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon .
Now this one &apos;s the tomato tickler .
And I was permanently hooked .
Now this society has no central authority .
Nobody &apos;s in charge .
So bees have social healthcare .
It &apos;s a natural antibiotic .
So what &apos;s going on ?
We &apos;re down to about two million hives of bees , we think .
We stopped planting cover crops .
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures .
And then there &apos;s pesticides .
This small bee is holding up a large mirror .
How much is it going to take to contaminate humans ?
You &apos;ve probably heard about it .
This is a new class of insecticides .
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing .
It &apos;s called varroa destructor .
It &apos;s aptly named .
Let me put this all together for you .
But what if I lived in a food desert ?
And it &apos;s not just our honeybees .
They &apos;re providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees .
We need all of our bees .
So what are we going to do ?
It turns out , it &apos;s hopeful . It &apos;s hopeful .
Set aside farmland .
And we need to diversify our farms .
On behalf of the bees , thank you .
Thank you . Just a quick question .
Maria Spivak : Yeah .
About 20 years ago , we were at a 15-percent loss .
So it &apos;s getting precarious .
We &apos;re kind of at a tipping point .
We can &apos;t really afford to lose that many more .
Thank you .
And the consensus was : it really worked .
This year we were thinking , &quot; Why does it work ? &quot;
The processing , of course , begins with the eyes .
We &apos;re only going to talk about three of them .
So the first one is called the ventral stream .
It &apos;s on this side of the brain .
It &apos;s the &quot; what &quot; detector .
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .
You &apos;d be activating the dorsal stream if you did that .
The third part that I &apos;d like to talk about is the limbic system .
And it &apos;s the part that feels .
It &apos;s the selective logic .
It activates a different part of the brain .
So the point of this is what ?
The lessons for us are three-fold .
First , use images to clarify what we &apos;re trying to communicate .
So the low-tech version looks like this .
This is a time-lapse view of it .
You can ask the question , &quot; Who &apos;s the boss ? &quot;
You &apos;ll be able to figure that out .
Secondly , making them interactive .
Janet Echelman : Taking imagination seriously
I had to do something .
This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
So I tried bronze casting .
I was mesmerized .
So we had to create one .
Now it had a sense of place .
I walked underneath it for the first time .
My life was not going to be the same .
Its shape was too complex now .
So we had to create it .
My artistic horizons continue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Shimon Steinberg : Natural pest control ... using bugs !
Just take a magnifying glass . You see what I have here ?
That &apos;s a magnifier times 10 .
Yeah , times 10 .
Just open it .
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .
Just have a look at the plants .
Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples .
What is a pest ?
What damage &#91; does &#93; it actually inflict on the plant ?
Let &apos;s have a look at that .
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict .
But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider .
By the way , they are hungry always .
And there is another example : aphids .
By the way , it &apos;s springtime now in Israel .
Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females .
No males at all .
Parthenogenesis , &#91; as it &#93; was so called .
And they are very happy with that , apparently .
Here we can see the damage .
Here we are not talking about a predator .
By the way , the aphid tries to escape .
This is all natural . This is all natural .
This is not fiction , nothing at all .
But this is the end result .
The birth is almost complete .
And this is of course not the end of it .
Again , we &apos;ll start first with the pest : the thrips .
If you can see this , sweet peppers .
This is not just an exotic , ornamental sweet pepper .
And again , in action .
So this is a very positive situation , by the way .
Everything is just fine under these circumstances .
What we do is actually this .
Many different parts .
And that &apos;s what we get , in fact .
You see under a microscope .
You see in the upper left corner , you see a single predatory mite .
And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites .
You see this ampoule . You see this one .
I have one gram of those predatory mites .
And no , we do not disrupt the balance .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
And what is the impact ?
So the impact is very strong .
Why good bugs ?
It &apos;s the same , and it can happen very quickly .
It hardly happens .
And thirdly , public demand .
Because , you see , this is the reality .
Have a look at the gap .
I think it &apos;s times 100 or something like that .
Twenty-five billion .
So there is a huge gap to bridge .
So actually , how can we do it ?
And this gap really narrows .
Step by step , it does narrow .
Thank you .
This is the ocean as I used to know it .
First , just a little bit about me .
It &apos;s like you dipped a marble in water .
Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up .
We &apos;re warming the climate .
So this really matters .
Now , let &apos;s take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit .
And they can handle water .
They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes .
When the water goes down , they know what to do .
In fact , those entire communities really don &apos;t have many options .
They don &apos;t have another thing they can do .
You see a lot of oil on the ocean .
You see a lot of oil on the shoreline .
Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic .
It &apos;s really messy .
And they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach .
They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags .
I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do with all that stuff .
Meanwhile , there are still people trying to use the beach .
They don &apos;t see the little , tiny sign that says : &quot; Stay out of the water . &quot;
You see people who are really shell-shocked .
They are very hardworking people .
They &apos;re finding that their world is really collapsing .
These are the things that you can see .
What &apos;s going on underwater ?
Well , some people say there are oil plumes .
Some people say there are not oil plumes .
So this is the Gulf of Mexico , sparkling place full of fish .
I think it &apos;s being hidden on purpose .
But you can see it .
Okay .
We heard that bacteria eat oil ?
So do sea turtles .
Turtles eat it . It gets in the gills of fish .
These guys have to swim around through it .
He has no bookings left .
Everybody wanted their deposit back . Everybody is fleeing .
That &apos;s the story of thousands of people .
Their numbers have never recovered .
So the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable .
It &apos;s going to take longer for some things .
These tuna swim the entire ocean .
They don &apos;t usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway .
But these are really high-performance athletic animals .
It &apos;s not like we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s been okay .
And they populate much larger areas .
The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways .
The biological effects are certainly hemispheric .
And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do .
Mainly what they &apos;re doing is booms and dispersants .
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool .
The booms are only about 13 inches in diameter .
So it &apos;s just absolutely crazy .
Here are shrimp boats employed .
Here they are working .
All they &apos;re doing is stirring it .
It &apos;s just ridiculous .
These birds make a living by diving into the water .
It &apos;s really , really important that we express our compassion .
I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident .
I think that this is the result of gross negligence .
Not just B.P.
We could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need .
And you &apos;d have some idea of what to do .
That &apos;s certainly one of the things we need to do .
Now this has been a problem for a very , very long time .
That &apos;s what it would really mean to be conservative .
I think there are signs of hope .
We seem to be waking up a little bit .
So it &apos;s a continued fight .
It &apos;s a historic moment right now .
The first offshore wells were called whales .
We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time .
Now are we stuck with this ?
Who says it &apos;s too expensive ?
People who sell us fossil fuels .
Energy is always a moral issue .
It &apos;s an issue that is moral right now .
It &apos;s a matter of right and wrong .
Thank you very much .
Martin Jacques : Understanding the rise of China
The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
That &apos;s just a decade away .
China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
This is an illusion .
How do we try to understand what China is ?
We can &apos;t .
It &apos;s never been the case .
And what does it mean ?
The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
One country , two systems .
&quot; Window dressing .
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot;
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
Think of German unification , 1990 .
What happened ?
One nation , one system .
That is the nation-state mentality .
It doesn &apos;t work .
India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil -- all of them are multiracial .
The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only multiracial really at the margins .
So the question is , why ?
It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
Know that China believes in the market and the state .
The state is everywhere in China .
Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
But it &apos;s not .
I mean , take the question of East Asia .
Now the largest economic region in the world .
And there are two consequences of this .
Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
When did that last happen ?
I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
Take the 19th century , for example .
But this , alas , is no longer true .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
This is the new &#91; Wuhan &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
Well , law is also a powerful driver of human behavior .
And our guide was a local science teacher .
The stories started pouring out .
You have to go in a school bus . &quot;
But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg .
So , what do we do about it ?
And so we peer through a legal microscope , and look at everything .
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect .
Absolutely vital .
Is it working ?
What does the macro-data show us ?
Let &apos;s go to schools .
Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law .
They &apos;re threatened with a legal claim .
It doesn &apos;t seem to be working very well does it ?
Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington .
That means all the boys are going to be ADD .
They &apos;ll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac .
So , none of these people are doing what they think is right .
Life is complicated enough without legal fear .
And so the state can come in .
It actually changes the way people think .
Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment .
So , how do you restore trust ?
We &apos;ve forgotten that second part .
So , how do we rebuild it ?
Life is too complex for ...
Life is too complex for a software program .
And so here is the fourth proposition .
The constitution is only 16 pages long .
Worked pretty well for 200 years .
And how do you make it simple ?
We have to rehumanize the law .
That person doesn &apos;t exist today .
This is the hardest hurdle .
Alastair Parvin : Architecture for the people by the people
That &apos;s our kind of working presumption .
And I think it &apos;s wrong , actually .
The economy ran out of jobs .
And a couple of things struck me about this .
One , don &apos;t listen to career advisers .
And a good place to start is your own paycheck .
That &apos;s about 36,000 , 37,000 dollars .
So here &apos;s a story .
There &apos;s bullying . We can &apos;t control them .
Instead , get rid of the school bell .
And a lot of people can &apos;t even afford them .
How will we sell design services ?
And that &apos;s a good thing .
And that began with open-source software .
And they &apos;re distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities .
That really is an industrial revolution .
And we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture .
It uses wedge and peg connections .
They don &apos;t need any traditional construction skills .
Of course , the house is never finished .
One of them is that it &apos;s always incredibly sociable .
People get confused between construction work and having fun .
Like , never designing a piece that can &apos;t be lifted up .
Don &apos;t reinvent the wheel every time .
A kind of Wikipedia for stuff ?
How much would that change the rules ?
And I think the technology &apos;s on our side .
Thank you very much .
The fact is -- uh-uh .
And we &apos;ve accomplished close to zip .
But in fact , they &apos;re growing faster .
I don &apos;t want to depress you too much .
Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP .
Instead , we spend our time talking .
But , of course , the natural world , polar bears .
They will completely lose .
And there &apos;s no adaption .
So this problem is absolutely soluble .
And I know for certain that that will work .
And the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
The result of that was pretty dramatic .
There &apos;s no big mystery about it .
But it clearly cools down .
And one other thing : it &apos;s fast .
But if you do this , it &apos;s quick .
And the answer seems to be yes .
This topic is also old .
I &apos;m not saying we shouldn &apos;t cut emissions .
We should , but it made exactly this point .
The one new thing is this essay .
It was very hard to calculate from first principles . I was stumped .
That &apos;s called the photophoretic force .
Now , suppose that space aliens arrived .
And the box has two knobs .
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature .
We have no global governance .
But we &apos;re building that box .
Even when they &apos;re doing it for other reasons .
We need a broader debate .
It &apos;s very cheap . We have a lot of leverage .
And that calculation isn &apos;t much in dispute .
But here &apos;s a case which is harder to reject .
That &apos;s an absolutely possible scenario .
But there is a problem with that view .
Should we do serious research on this topic ?
A very small amount of money would get us some .
But I have a lot of reservations .
Another thing is , maybe we need a treaty .
A treaty that decides who gets to do this .
Thank you very much .
Nellie McKay : &quot; Clonie &quot;
&quot; Ha , I &apos;m the only person I ever loved . &quot;
Dan Dennett : Cute , sexy , sweet , funny
Exactly . Exactly . And it is a strange inversion .
We adore babies because they &apos;re so cute .
There &apos;s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey .
Now you might think , ah , there &apos;s a solution : hallucinations .
That would be one way of doing it , but there &apos;s a quicker way .
That &apos;s all there is to it .
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus .
So nature works on many levels here .
This is the strange inversion .
Thank you very much .
It happened 225 years ago .
It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton .
It &apos;s the child that &apos;s remembered .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through at this time .
That will blow away a lot of the opposition .
So , let &apos;s leave that aside .
It &apos;s not only cold , but very dry .
What would they need in order to grow on the surface ?
So there &apos;s no point in looking . &quot;
There is something called pit lamping .
You take -- that &apos;s a Canadian expression .
I call these creatures sunflowers .
They look like , maybe like sunflowers .
That &apos;s another wonderful opportunity that &apos;s opening .
That would be a fun thing to do .
Thank you .
I graduated high school in Cleveland , Ohio , 1975 .
This brings us to why a lot of us , who are professionals , are now , as they say , in diaspora .
Very interesting .
How many people do you think are on that taxi ?
Some of us do survive malaria ; we do survive AIDS .
Now that is less than a year old , in an operating room .
That &apos;s sterilizing equipment in Nigeria .
You remember all that oil ?
You can say some of this is education .
You can say it &apos;s hygiene . I &apos;m not pleading poverty .
Now , have a look at that . That &apos;s the anesthesiology machine .
And that &apos;s my specialty , right ?
So , these are the problems .
There we go -- we &apos;re going on a mission .
Health is wealth , in the words of Hans Rosling .
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first .
So , here we are , mission . Big trouble .
Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble .
That &apos;s Mike , Mike comes out from Mississippi .
Does he look like he &apos;s happy ?
Yes , let &apos;s just go work this thing out .
We get a lot of donated equipment .
But we had problems with it . We had severe problems there .
So what we going to do now ?
Well , nowadays everything &apos;s on PAX anyway .
And we were doing open-heart surgery .
You still get people who believe in it and they came .
At 67 percent oxygen saturation , the normal is about 97 .
The oxygen tanks didn &apos;t quite work right .
But how many did we do the first one ? 12 .
We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully .
Have you seen one of those before ?
No ? Yes ? Doesn &apos;t matter , it worked .
Thank you . Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company .
And that &apos;s a perfect example of one .
That &apos;s exactly how the outlets are designed .
Yes , it will take a solar panel . Yes a solar panel will charge it .
Is it dental surgery you want ? General surgery you want ?
Decide which instruments , stock it up with consumables .
And currently we &apos;re working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site .
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new .
This picture was taken last year .
These are members of my graduating class , 1986 .
African people , because they will do it with a passion , I hope .
Thank you .
I happen to have triplets .
They &apos;re little . They &apos;re five years old .
Here &apos;s a picture of the kids .
That &apos;s Sage and Annalisa and Rider .
Now , I also happen to be gay .
Philanthropy is the market for love .
But it doesn &apos;t seem to be working .
We have two rulebooks .
We &apos;ll put you on the cover of Wired magazine .
Not necessarily . They might be smart .
But they have to be asked .
The fourth area is time .
And the last area is profit itself .
So why do we think this way ?
Well , this created a real problem for these people , right ?
Here they &apos;ve come all the way across the Atlantic to make all this money .
Making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell .
What were they to do about this ?
Well , charity became their answer .
There are a lot of problems with this question .
I &apos;m going to just focus on two .
2002 was our most successful year ever .
And then we went out of business , suddenly and traumatically .
Why ? Well , the short story is , our sponsor split on us .
The overhead went up .
That &apos;s about 300 billion dollars a year .
Now we &apos;re talking scale .
Dan Pallotta : Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you .
Jamil Abu-Wardeh : The Axis of Evil Middle East Comedy Tour
Now , I had friends in the U.S.
who had started a successful new tribe .
I had four phases to this plan .
and ideas du bon marche .
Let &apos;s just say &quot; value for money . &quot;
And one more thing : No , don &apos;t F it up . &quot;
This is all true .
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East .
Now , were the Axis successful ?
Anywhere you go .
I called it &quot; Three Guys and Wonho . &quot;
It really is his name .
20 years ago , no one had heard of it .
Look at it now .
Enough .
Clearly , there are wrongs that need to be righted .
We &apos;ve started in our region .
Thank you .
And I called it the Zimbabwe Institute of Vigital Arts .
Some logos designed by my students .
So it &apos;s a special-interest writing system .
It &apos;s called Sankofa .
All the paths lead to and from God .
Shü-mom is a writing system .
Thank you very much .
Mark Roth : Suspended animation is within our grasp
So what do I mean when I say &quot; suspended animation &quot; ?
So then there &apos;s also my favorite example of suspended animation .
This is Sea-Monkeys .
Those of you with children , you know about them .
Well , I wasn &apos;t so interested in the swimming .
She got cranky and just went home .
So , these are miracles , right ?
These are truly miraculous things that happen .
And it &apos;s true . It &apos;s true .
That &apos;s over 50 percent .
We can see it in a variety of different organisms .
One of the creatures we see it in is a fish .
But , of course , she was also extremely cold .
It &apos;s a really good thing .
You know ?
And so , we went looking for such things .
Well , we had a lot of them .
It &apos;s filled with this toxic gas , hydrogen sulfide .
Now , hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us .
We make it ourselves .
The highest concentration is in our brains .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily toxic thing .
It &apos;s really going to be OK . &quot;
I mean , who knows ?
It stopped moving .
It appeared dead .
Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold .
And here &apos;s the really important point .
Now , this was cosmic .
Well this was really cool .
A miracle ?
Thank you very much .
AV : We did .
AV : That spawned a dating site .
That &apos;s a subject that we want to dive into .
These are our three sons .
I remember vividly , sitting there in the hospital .
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child .
AV : We , or I ?
RG : I &apos;m sorry .
Misuse of the pronoun .
And I was there with my arms open .
So I was bracing myself for the moment .
And you can see , our eyes were glistening .
And it was also , of course , surreal .
And this was all quite remarkable .
And so we &apos;ve done something here that is heretical .
You &apos;re not allowed to chart love .
You &apos;re either in love , or you &apos;re not in love .
You love , or you don &apos;t love .
RG : I &apos;m a very affectionate uncle , very affectionate uncle .
RG : Uh oh .
RG : The far left . AV : No !
RG : Cruel .
AV : Nothing more to be said .
I &apos;ll move on to taboo number two .
I enjoyed being pregnant . I loved it .
So Alisa &apos;s experience is not isolated .
So it was a very difficult time .
There &apos;s not really a lot of community support around it .
There &apos;s really no ceremony , rituals , or rites .
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies .
We were despondent .
There &apos;s something missing from these studies .
It can &apos;t possibly be that bad .
As you get older , you become more stable .
So I &apos;m not going to go .
RG : And so in effect , we trade average happiness .
There &apos;s another factor in our case .
It &apos;s a bad idea . Don &apos;t do it . &quot;
And we obviously went forward . We did .
And so how about that average baseline of happiness ?
Can we move that up a little bit ?
RG + AV : Thank you .
Steve Jurvetson : Model rocketry
Baking soda and vinegar .
These rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide .
They use solid propellant most frequently .
It &apos;s a strange kind of love .
Mavericks : we had to call it Rocket Mavericks .
Here was a drag race .
Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic .
Voices : Woohoo ! Yeah . Nice .
They &apos;re yelling deploy . Voices : Oh shit .
Voices : It &apos;s going ballistic . Oh shit .
SJ : And I &apos;ll just be quiet .
Voices : No .
Up , up , up .
SJ : And that &apos;s me over there , taking photos the whole way .
Things often go wrong .
It &apos;s a cadence you can &apos;t quite imagine .
Thank you .
Sebastian Wernicke : Lies , damned lies and statistics
And that &apos;s a huge amount of data .
Oh , well .
Now , while ...
I &apos;ll give you three examples .
You &apos;ll all stay with me .
It &apos;s perfectly fine .
Now , let &apos;s go to the visuals .
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker .
Color plays a very important role .
And I call this tool the TEDPad .
So , download it and have fun with it .
And so I begin with a story about my childhood .
We all are products of our childhood experiences .
And the whole class would say , &quot; Shut up , Freeman . &quot;
And there was a designated kicker every day .
And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King .
And I said to my parents , &quot; I &apos;ve got to go .
I want to go . I want to be a part of this . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Absolutely not . &quot;
And we had a rough go of it .
You make me go to this . You make me listen .
And they came into my room the next morning .
They had not slept .
And they decided to do it .
I wanted a better education .
I did not want to have to have hand-me-down books .
And it has been for 50 years an experiment .
It &apos;s great work .
That &apos;s a big deal . It really is .
Quite frankly , you &apos;re talking about Americans .
Well a part of it , of course , is K-12 .
We need to strengthen K-12 .
I know . I know . I know .
Number one : high expectations .
Every foundation makes the difference in the next level .
He retook the course .
He now works at Harvard .
Nice story . Give him a hand for that too .
Test scores are important , but they &apos;re not the most important thing .
But she had a factor that was very important .
She never missed a day of school , K-12 .
There was fire in that belly .
Big hand for her . Big hand for her .
And so high expectations , very important .
Students are not taught to work in groups .
They had food they had packed out .
They knew they were working on AIDS research .
They were looking at this amazing protein design .
And what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work .
Let me get the staff to help me out . &quot;
It was that connecting .
Give him a big hand for that .
And so we redesigned chemistry , we redesigned physics .
Do you know that ?
They need to be engaged .
It &apos;s called academic innovation .
And what does all of that mean ?
Aristotle said , &quot; Excellence is never an accident .
Thank you all very much .
But he didn &apos;t have Wikipedia .
I didn &apos;t have the rest of my life to do this project .
I had maybe nine months .
So , starting with steel : how do you make steel ?
Can I come up and get some iron ? &quot;
That &apos;s me getting mica .
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now .
But this is it .
So there &apos;s a picture of my toaster .
And there it is on the shelves .
Thanks .
TT : Yeah , I did plug it in .
So the wires were uninsulated .
Thomas Thwaites . TT : Thanks .
Jane Chen : A warm embrace that saves lives
Now open your eyes .
What about a life ?
Four million of these babies die annually .
That is the primary function of an incubator .
I &apos;ve seen this firsthand over and over again .
So , this is what we came up with .
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby .
There &apos;s no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily .
But the magic is in this pouch of wax .
This is a phase-change material .
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .
It &apos;s a pretty accurate description .
Today , we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses .
We will see 30,000 new infected websites .
Today &apos;s cybercriminal , what do they look like ?
Check out this one I found .
Turns out that &apos;s not cool .
But it goes further .
Now , there are many ways you can get infected .
You will have come in contact with some of them .
Now there are many ways you can get infected .
I want to show you a couple of my favorites .
This is a little USB key .
Well , you could try looking really cute .
Awww .
Or , in my case , awkward and pathetic .
So let &apos;s have a look here on my victim computer .
What I &apos;m going to do is plug in the USB key .
Malware is very boring otherwise .
We can access your documents , your data .
You can turn on the webcam .
That can be very embarrassing .
This is a script .
It &apos;s code which will be interpreted on the webpage .
It creates some very serious alerts .
Oh look , a child porn proxy server .
We really should clean that up .
Now I liked it better when viruses were free .
So let &apos;s take this a little further .
And our cybercriminals had done the same thing .
We used Google .
One of these was more stereotypical for me .
They were working on the third floor .
The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well .
Let me come back to that in just a minute .
So I ran a little scan .
TEDAttendees , HyattLB . Where do you think I &apos;m staying ?
Sophos _ Visitors , SANSEMEA , companies I work with .
Loganwifi , that &apos;s in Boston . HiltonLondon .
This is how geeks party .
So let &apos;s make this a little bit more interesting .
Let &apos;s talk about you .
Things get more interesting .
This isn &apos;t an exact science , but it gets pretty accurate .
Would someone be able to abuse it ? &quot;
Get a secure password .
Find these resources . Apply them .
Thank you .
It &apos;s called &quot; Peace on Earth . &quot;
Ryan Holladay : To hear this music you have to be there . Literally
Which brought us to this .
Let &apos;s take a closer look .
Let &apos;s look at one example here .
This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins .
Thank you .
So let the story begin .
His name was Nikola , Nikola Tesla .
Let me show you .
Tesla , what is 236 multiplied by 501 ?
Nikola Tesla : The result is 118,236 .
Tree . Chair . Girl .
Probably a form of synesthesia .
NT : I needed no models , drawings or experiments .
Only then do I construct it .
MT : His great idea was alternating current .
It is the magic of science .
He even photographed the bones of the human body .
But Tesla &apos;s success didn &apos;t last .
NT : I had bigger ideas .
Illuminating the city was only the beginning .
NT : They wouldn &apos;t give me the money .
NT : Yes , that was a big mistake .
MT : Tesla &apos;s career as an inventor never recovered .
He became a recluse .
His legacy is with us still .
Tesla &apos;s insight was profound .
MT : Tesla thought he had the answer .
We are still asking the question .
Thank you .
Michelle Obama : A plea for education
Can you believe that ?
The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago .
That &apos;s the real part of Chicago .
Neither of them attended university .
He was grateful for what he had .
He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder .
I know , how romantic .
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
We all know .
You &apos;re going to write the next chapter in history .
They allowed for no obstacles .
As the sign said back there , &quot; without limitations . &quot;
Please remember that .
I never did it .
I loved getting As .
I liked being smart .
I liked being on time . I liked getting my work done .
You too can pave the way .
You now have control over your own destiny .
And it won &apos;t be easy -- that &apos;s for sure .
But you have everything you need .
My husband works in this big office .
They call it the Oval Office .
Because we are counting on you .
Because the world is big .
And it &apos;s full of challenges .
Chrystia Freeland : The rise of the new global super-rich
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.
today account for more than eight percent of the national income .
Just think about it .
In practice , getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult .
After all , no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism .
In and of themselves , these aren &apos;t too mysterious .
Just think about it .
We have superstar technologists .
We have superstar bankers .
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects .
There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
I &apos;m even more of a fan of globalization .
So what &apos;s not to like ?
Well , a few things .
Think about Amazon , Apple , Google , Starbucks .
Again , this is no mere hypothetical .
As income inequality increases , social mobility decreases .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
The same is true of globalization .
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario .
We created the modern welfare state .
We created public education .
We created public health care .
We created public pensions .
We created unions .
We need a new New Deal .
What is it about flying cars ?
We &apos;ve wanted to do this for about a hundred years .
You take off and land at a local airport .
And it works .
within the light sport aircraft category .
And at 110 lbs . , driving .
Now let &apos;s see it in action .
You &apos;re not powering the propeller , you &apos;re powering the wheels .
And that &apos;s the automated wing-folding mechanism .
That &apos;s real time .
Radio : It actually flew . Yes .
Radio 2 : That was gorgeous .
Radio : What did you think of that ?
That was beautiful from up here , I tell you .
Here &apos;s why .
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved .
Just fold up the wings and keep going .
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure .
Devdutt Pattanaik : East vs. West -- the myths that mystify
&quot; How come ? &quot; said Kartikeya .
&apos;My world &apos; is subjective .
It &apos;s emotional . It &apos;s personal .
It &apos;s perceptions , thoughts , feelings , dreams .
It is the belief system that we carry .
Yours is faith .
Yours is illogical .
This river lends itself to India &apos;s name .
India . Indus .
We don &apos;t know who he was .
Alexander asked , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
and the gymnosophist answered , &quot; I &apos;m experiencing nothingness . &quot;
Then the gymnosophist asked , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
and Alexander said , &quot; I am conquering the world . &quot;
And they both laughed .
The gymnosophist said , &quot; Why is he conquering the world ?
It &apos;s pointless . &quot;
What a waste of a life . &quot;
That &apos;s what he heard .
&quot; What should you not be ?
He heard a very different story .
Bharat also conquered the world .
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist .
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins .
But you don &apos;t cross it once .
You go to and fro endlessly .
It was called the Vaitarani .
And what do you do at the end of 10 days ?
You dunk it in the river .
Because it has to end .
And next year , she will come back .
&quot; Groundhog Day . &quot;
Two different mythologies .
Which is right ?
Two different mythologies , two different ways of looking at the world .
One linear , one cyclical .
One believes this is the one and only life .
And so , the denominator of Alexander &apos;s life was one .
The denominator of the gymnosophist &apos;s life was infinity .
Who knows ?
Take a look .
And then look at business .
Standard business model : vision , mission , values , processes .
It &apos;s always about taste .
It &apos;s always about my taste .
There is no orchestra conductor .
It is not about documentation and contract .
It &apos;s about conversation and faith .
And people are okay with it .
And then globalization is taking place .
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in .
Which is rooted in one-life culture .
It is bound to happen .
I did not want to study surgery . Don &apos;t ask me why .
I love mythology too much .
So , I had to teach it to myself .
And I worked in the healthcare industry .
How do you parameterize &quot; mostly &quot; ?
Sounds so simple .
But belief is not measurable .
So , how do you construct belief ?
You want to see God .
The customer is happy , because the customer is God .
And it has .
So , then we come back to Alexander and to the gymnosophist .
So , I will not answer the question .
Understand it .
Who sees it all ?
Varuna has but a thousand eyes .
Indra , a hundred .
You and I , only two .
Thank you . Namaste .
The sweet anxiety of choice .
Let me give you an example .
But what you are buying now is great . &quot;
Now , why were Manya &apos;s customers so irrational ?
Now , we rarely make really totally rational choices .
Choices are influenced by our unconscious , by our community .
We &apos;re also guessing what is socially acceptable choice .
Now , choices are anxiety-provoking .
They are linked to risks , losses .
They are highly unpredictable .
And now , I need to choose a sperm donor . &quot;
I looked at this woman in shock .
&quot; Sperm donor ? What &apos;s the rush ? &quot;
Now , we think today that we can prevent these risks .
Now , chance is actually becoming very traumatic .
Now , we delivered the conference in such a way .
We decoded our genome .
We know about our brains more than before .
Ignorance and denial are on the rise .
Now , what does that mean ?
And who would want to tax one &apos;s son ?
And there is an important message that I did learn .
It really prevented us to think about social change .
Now , we should not forget that choice is always linked to change .
We can choose to have more wolves .
We have a possibility to make changes .
Thank you .
You needed easy access to the fields .
Life was very small for most people .
Production was centralized in assembly plants .
You had centralized energy production .
And then you had networks that developed .
You had separated functions , increasingly .
Imagine that .
Now there &apos;s some trends that will impact cities .
First of all , work is becoming distributed and mobile .
How can we have the good stuff without the bad ?
The 20 arrondissements of Paris are these little neighborhoods .
So we said , let &apos;s start with that neighborhood cell .
And he might be right .
And then we can form , in effect , a mesh network .
The Highline in Manhattan is very similar .
These are some of the vehicles that we &apos;ve been working on .
We have Hubway here in Boston , the Vélib &apos; system in Paris .
You just spin and go directly in .
It &apos;s not really a problem .
You have nobody to make eye contact with .
You don &apos;t know if it &apos;s going to run you over .
Housing is another area where we can really improve .
We don &apos;t really believe in cameras to do things in homes .
We think these little wireless sensors are more effective .
We think workplaces should be shared .
This is Starbucks , you know .
We need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration .
We &apos;re not doing a very good job with that .
They &apos;re places for people .
Thank you .
Clay Shirky : How the Internet will transform government
Let &apos;s start here .
Can you spot the vegetable ?
A post that read : &quot; Goodbye . &quot;
I really enjoyed doing this .
Thank you for reading . Goodbye . &quot;
You can guess what happened next , right ?
Except , of course , this morning .
Now , this isn &apos;t just a contemporaneous question .
What would this lead to ?
Well , obviously , it would lead to world peace .
World peace .
The telephone ?
You guessed it : world peace .
What they got exactly wrong was what happens next .
More media always means more arguing .
That &apos;s what happens when the media &apos;s space expands .
We are a pro-printing press society .
If you don &apos;t tell us how you did it , we won &apos;t trust you .
But the other thing they needed was speed .
The scientific revolution wasn &apos;t created by the printing press .
Well , predictions of world peace ? Check .
More arguing ? Gold star on that one .
I mean , YouTube is just a gold mine .
Better arguing ? That &apos;s the question .
All right . They look like org charts .
This is feudalism : one owner , many workers .
Now , that &apos;s fine for the commercial software industry .
It really is Microsoft &apos;s Office . It &apos;s Adobe &apos;s Photoshop .
The corporation owns the software .
The programmers come and go .
This is Linus Torvalds .
But Torvalds said , &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to do that . &quot;
His point of view on this was very clear .
This is a tremendously complicated process .
And he called it &quot; Git . &quot; Git is distributed version control .
This is cooperation without coordination .
This is the big change .
This is a graph of the Ruby community .
So , the law is also dependency-related .
So there &apos;s that as a site for source code management .
Right .
And it includes this very evocative screenshot .
This is a called a &quot; diff , &quot; this thing on the right here .
The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted .
The stuff in green is the stuff that got added .
Programmers take this capability for granted .
Part of the problem , of course , is just a lack of information .
This , graphically , was the answer .
The bigger problem , of course , is power .
They are experimenting with openness .
So consider this .
It was the expectation of the citizens that she would not be censored .
That &apos;s now the state we &apos;re in with these collaboration tools .
We have them . We &apos;ve seen them . They work .
Can we use them ?
Can we apply the techniques that worked here to this ?
Thank you for listening .
Thank you . Thank you .
So why is that ?
Well , here is a thought experiment for you .
Or maybe you turn to the past .
Maybe you look at the past and see .
Has it done any good ?
And worst of all , we will never know .
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example .
Africans have already got a lot of aid .
These are the blue bars .
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress .
We have no idea . We don &apos;t know what the counterfactual is .
There &apos;s only one Africa .
So what do you do ?
We don &apos;t know .
So here are some other questions .
So you have your million .
Bed nets are very cheap .
So , what do you do ?
How do you know ?
And a third question : Education .
Maybe that &apos;s the solution , maybe we should send kids to school .
But how do you do that ?
Do you provide school lunch ?
How do you know ?
So here is the thing .
So I start with immunization .
Here &apos;s Udaipur District , Rajasthan . Beautiful .
That &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
So what is the problem ?
It &apos;s going from intention to action .
So these are simple ideas , but we didn &apos;t know .
So let &apos;s try them .
So the blue dots are selected randomly .
Now , a kilo of lentils is tiny .
So what do we find ?
Well , beforehand , everything is the same .
That &apos;s the beauty of randomization .
That &apos;s full immunization .
That &apos;s not bad , that &apos;s a good improvement .
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent .
So here you &apos;ve got your answer .
Now , you might say , &quot; Well , but it &apos;s not sustainable .
We cannot keep giving lentils to people . &quot;
How about bed nets ?
We can know the answer to this question .
We can just run an experiment .
And now we can see what happens .
So , how about the purchasing ?
If they get it for free , they use it .
How about the long term ?
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit .
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
So what &apos;s the best ?
Well , in business , that &apos;s certainly not the way we would go about it .
Consider for example transporting goods .
And here are the most surprising results .
So let &apos;s go back to Haiti for a moment .
And yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
So , why is that ?
And the problem of poverty is not like that .
There &apos;s no silver bullet .
And that &apos;s very frustrating .
But look what we just did today .
Here &apos;s an example of how this can be powerful .
Deworming .
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines .
They are not beautiful and don &apos;t kill anybody .
So this evidence is powerful .
It can prompt action .
So we should get started now .
It &apos;s not going to be easy .
It &apos;s a very slow process .
It &apos;s a slow , deliberative process of discovery .
Thank you .
Parag Khanna : Mapping the future of countries
Do we live in a borderless world ?
Now , many of you will object .
You could call it TEDistan .
How do we distribute ourselves around the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the world of 1945 .
Over 50 new countries were born .
India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , South East Asian nations created .
Then came the end of the Cold War .
Today we have 200 countries in the world .
Why do they call it that ?
China isn &apos;t conquering Mongolia .
It &apos;s buying it .
So let &apos;s apply this principle to Siberia .
But who is it going to feed ?
That &apos;s larger than the entire population of Russia .
But hold on . This map is 700 years old .
Again , globalization Chinese style .
Well it &apos;s China &apos;s turn again .
It starts with the global hubs .
Tokyo , Seoul , Beijing , Shanghai , Hong Kong , Singapore and Sidney .
Then there is trade .
Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy .
Now it encourages it .
Let &apos;s start with Iraq .
The reason is Kurdistan .
But what are they guarding ?
Is it really a border on the map ?
No . It &apos;s the pipelines .
I don &apos;t believe we should .
That is , of course , in Palestine .
This is the Hejaz Railway .
The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus .
But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters , ruins .
Why is it all he &apos;s talking about is oil ? &quot;
A great deal of them .
Just take Azerbaijan .
And that is , of course , Europe .
In 2004 , 15 new countries joined the E.U.
I mentioned Azerbaijan before .
Of course , we can &apos;t forget Africa .
Now let &apos;s go up to the Arctic Circle .
Who will win ? Canada ? Russia ? The United States ?
Actually Greenland .
So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
What is the lesson from all of this ?
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline .
It &apos;s constantly morphing and changing the world , like climate change .
Now we fear changes on the map .
Thank you .
Elizabeth Lesser : Take &quot; the Other &quot; to lunch
I call them &quot; the mystic &quot; and &quot; the warrior . &quot;
I was the freak of the family .
So , looking for answers , I went to Catholic mass .
I tagged along with my neighbors .
I read Sartre and Socrates .
They &apos;ve made me a proud I-don &apos;t-know-it-all .
She &apos;s worried .
This , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the interrelated structure of reality . &quot;
Who wrote that ?
This is why I &apos;m launching a new initiative .
Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict .
Be curious ; be conversational ; be real .
And listen .
From there , we dove in .
What issues deeply concern you ?
&quot; What ? &quot; she wanted to know .
Well , she was shocked .
Neither of us had tried to change the other .
Who should you invite to lunch ?
Probably not .
Because ubuntu work is slow , and it &apos;s difficult .
I &apos;ll meet you there . &quot;
Alwar Balasubramaniam : Art of substance and absence
How did you do ? &quot;
And then school also started supporting me .
You know , like just adjacent to me .
I think you should study in a school of art .
You just quit school and come there . &quot;
But it is just a kind of trace of that time .
And that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
So this is called &quot; Self In Progress . &quot;
It &apos;s almost like a 3D photograph .
So it &apos;s almost like fossils for the future .
This is the trace of fire , this is the trace of sun .
This is called &quot; Dawn to Dawn . &quot;
So it took about 24 hours to get this line .
So like let &apos;s say even a simple act .
Can you just raise the hand ?
Why the cow was crossing the road , you know .
The answer can be so different if Potter said it .
He would say , &quot; For the greater good . &quot;
It just all depends on one &apos;s perception .
And context , what is really context ?
Because I always think meaning doesn &apos;t really exist .
It &apos;s just created by the mind .
This is how we &apos;ve been taught in school .
It &apos;s just captured through from the lamp .
This is called &quot; Limit Out . &quot;
This is an exact negative .
And we &apos;re just pulling the wall off the gallery .
Again , &quot; Inward Out . &quot;
It &apos;s a full-figure cast from myself .
It &apos;s about eight inches deep .
I couldn &apos;t find it .
It &apos;s called Odonil .
This is the work I made out of that material .
They never wrote back to me .
They said , &quot; Of course .
Please come for the show . &quot;
And they did .
And I was like , &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
&quot; Light makes dark and now evaporating self .
I said , &quot; No , mom . It can &apos;t be .
So , I did this work for her .
It &apos;s called &quot; Emerging Angel . &quot;
So , the same sculpture after a few days .
This is after 15 / 20 days .
This gave me a greater faith .
When it &apos;s bounced on the moon , we see it .
The same thing in the darkroom .
The skin of this is also representing this .
And skin at the other end also represents the floor .
So that produced a shadow .
Then , again , that becomes an object .
Again , throwing light , then the third one .
And then again , at that point , there is no shadow .
I thought , &quot; Oh , good . Work is finished . &quot;
You can see the detail .
This is called &quot; Gravity . &quot;
This is called &quot; Kaayam . &quot;
Detail .
Thank you .
Bandi Mbubi : Demand a fair trade cell phone
I was 21 .
But first of all , I want you to do me a favor .
Can you imagine your world without it ?
It is a symbol of an interconnected world .
It is an anticorrosive heat conductor .
It is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts .
It would be great if the story ended there .
But don &apos;t throw away your phones yet .
Coltan is easily controlled by armed groups .
It has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet .
It has allowed momentous political change to take place .
So we are faced with a paradox .
It is time to be asking questions about technology .
Where does it come from ?
Who makes it ?
And for what ?
Recent U.K. legislation could be used in the same way .
But we &apos;re not there yet .
Communication was extremely difficult .
We demand fair trade food and fair trade clothes .
It is time to demand fair trade phones .
This is an idea worth spreading . Thank you .
Kathryn Schulz : Don &apos;t regret regret
So that &apos;s Johnny Depp , of course .
And that &apos;s Johnny Depp &apos;s shoulder .
That didn &apos;t happen to me .
I do that hourly .
I learned a lesson from it .
And okay , I wouldn &apos;t change it .
It &apos;s called a lobotomy .
What is regret ?
So in other words , regret requires two things .
And second of all , it requires imagination .
Why ?
I should have gone through that yellow light . &quot;
This session today is about behavioral economics .
Here &apos;s what the answers turn out to look like .
We wish we &apos;d gotten more of it .
We all know the short answer .
It feels terrible . Regret feels awful .
And the thought was , &quot; Make it go away ! &quot;
This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response .
We &apos;re not trying to solve the problem .
We just want it to vanish .
The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment .
What was I thinking ? &quot;
We can &apos;t identify with that part .
We don &apos;t understand that part .
Make it go away . Make it go away . &quot;
This is obviously an incredibly painful experience .
Text : Relpy to all .
Or you can have your last day at work .
So how are we supposed to live with this ?
We are all in this together .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case though .
And do you guys just want to see it ?
All right .
Because it &apos;s actually not that hideous .
It &apos;s just that I don &apos;t like how it looks .
But I &apos;ll let you see it anyway .
This is my tattoo .
I can guess what some of you are thinking .
Well it did .
The point isn &apos;t to live without any regrets .
Thank you .
Jeff Han : The radical promise of the multi-touch interface
This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time .
You know , like that .
Now , multi-touch sensing isn &apos;t completely new .
It &apos;s completely intuitive ; there &apos;s no instruction manual .
The interface just kind of disappears .
This is a photographer &apos;s light box application .
I can do that grossly with both of my hands , or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together .
Again , the interface just disappears here .
Now , of course , I can bring up a keyboard .
And I can bring that around , put that up there .
That leads to bad things , like RSI .
This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go .
So -- again , isn &apos;t this great ?
Audience : Where &apos;s your lab ?
It &apos;s pressure-sensitive , you can notice .
It &apos;s just so much fun playing around with too .
And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time .
And you notice what it does .
Thank you .
James Nachtwey : Moving photos of extreme drug-resistant TB
Thank you very much .
Toby Eccles : Invest in social change
Forty-three .
And how many previous times do you think they &apos;ve been in prison ?
Seven .
Now , of course , we care about the social value .
The idea is called the social impact bond .
So we have to raise some money .
And here &apos;s the opportunity .
So everyone wins here , right ?
Now , the offenders , they also benefit .
Essex only pays in the event that it &apos;s saving them care costs .
Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds .
That program started last month .
So what &apos;s caused this excitement ?
Why is this so different for people ?
The second piece it brings is rigor .
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
The last element is partnership .
So where does this leave us ?
Thank you .
Alisa Miller : The news about the news
How does the news shape the way we see the world ?
There was massive flooding in Indonesia .
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper .
And what about the web ?
The most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
And they , in fact , covered the same 24 news events .
I know we can do better .
And can we afford not to ? Thank you .
This is an image of the planet Earth .
For instance , this is a bird &apos;s-eye view of the EPFL campus .
This is pretty amazing .
Is that possible ?
Can I reconstruct social networks of the past ?
So , can I build time machines ?
Maybe we can just say , &quot; No , it &apos;s not possible . &quot;
This is what I call the information mushroom .
Vertically , you have the time .
and horizontally , the amount of digital information available .
How do we do that ?
One way is digitization .
I can digitize all these .
I can extract information from these .
So , it might not be enough .
So , I can do what historians do .
I can extrapolate .
I &apos;m extrapolating .
You have every change that was made in the city .
This is all there .
And these are administrative documents .
They are well structured in many cases .
&quot; How much will it cost ? &quot;
&quot; What are the chance of encountering pirates ? &quot;
How can we represent that form of uncertainty ?
Maybe there &apos;s not a single map .
Maybe there are several maps .
Again , Venice is extraordinary for that .
It &apos;s really a question of scale .
I thank you very much .
At first , the results were predictable .
Note that word &quot; cooperate . &quot;
Of course , in other ways , humans are so limited .
We &apos;re terrible at scale , computation and volume .
Or take another example : big data .
These records were human resource forms .
Thank you .
Ian Goldin : Navigating our global future
And it &apos;s clearly in the area of finance .
Globalization is getting more complex .
And this change is getting more rapid .
The future will be more unpredictable .
It did this a thousand years ago .
But there is an underbelly .
There are two Achilles &apos; heels of globalization .
This is a systemic risk , systemic shock .
That &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
It will continue .
So what will this do ?
Miniaturization as well .
We can develop any part of the body .
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine .
But the question is , &quot; Who will have it ? &quot;
So forget about retirements if you &apos;re young .
And then , the systemic risks .
It &apos;s going to require innovation .
It is vital that we do so .
Thank you .
So we &apos;ve provided subtitles .
Rich Player : How many 500s did you have ?
Poor Player : Just one .
Rich Player : I have three .
We had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side .
It &apos;s on the bottom right corner there .
That allowed us to watch participants &apos; consummatory behavior .
Poor Player : I don &apos;t know .
Rich Player : I love pretzels .
Poor Player : How much is that ?
Rich Player : You owe me 24 dollars .
You &apos;re going to lose all your money soon .
I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
I have so much money , it takes me forever .
I &apos;m pretty much untouchable at this point .
They &apos;ll never meet that stranger and the stranger will never meet them .
And we just monitor how much people give .
I know it sounds like I &apos;m making a joke .
And we just monitored how much candy participants took .
It &apos;s not difficult to discern that there are differences .
Even people at the top experience these outcomes .
So what do we do ?
Thank you .
Jean-Baptiste Michel : The mathematics of history
So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language .
But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s right .
I want to show you a couple of examples why .
That &apos;s a powerful historical force .
Now it &apos;s just the way it is .
But some verbs are irregular .
&quot; Yesterday I thought . &quot;
So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that ?
What &apos;s the origin of this ?
For instance , committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot .
Thank you very much .
Olafur Eliasson : Playing with space and light
In the studio we do a lot of experiments .
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory .
I don &apos;t necessarily think the film is so interesting .
I think there is a socializing dimension in , kind of , moving that border .
Who decides what reality is ?
The show was , in a sense , about that .
And my idea was to make the space tangible .
So look at this . Look at the girl .
&quot; Oh ! That was my foot there ! &quot;
How do we reconfigure it ?
&quot; What does it matter ? &quot;
Is art about that ?
And the water flows through the city with time .
And if I vote it makes a difference .
If I take a stand , it makes a difference . &quot;
The difference between thinking and doing .
Iceland , lower right corner , my favorite place .
These kinds of experiments , they filter into architectural models .
These are ongoing experiments .
It &apos;s made out of ice .
It &apos;s quite simple and fundamental .
I &apos;ve walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland .
It doesn &apos;t really tell you what you &apos;re looking at .
The big mountains far away , they move less .
And your body somehow knows that .
So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities .
It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension .
And why would we want to do that ?
Is there a sense of consequences ?
One could say this is about community , collectivity .
It &apos;s about being together .
How do we create public space ?
What does the word &quot; public &quot; mean today anyway ?
It &apos;s very much about this causality , consequences .
It &apos;s very much about the way we link thinking and doing .
So what is between thinking and doing ?
And right in-between thinking and doing , I would say , there is experience .
Experience is about responsibility .
Having an experience is taking part in the world .
Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility .
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you very much .
I want to start on a slightly somber note .
With all the side effects ?
Or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment ?
I think that is too simplistic .
Which got me thinking .
Now , why do you have to consume the tea ?
Why ? Because it makes a lot of sense .
And you know that .
Anyone in the audience want to take a stab ?
Baba Shiv : Whoa !
Okay , that &apos;s cool .
Because we want these puzzles to be difficult .
Now , here &apos;s another example .
Yeah , wow . Okay .
So , yeah , so this is again difficult .
How do you know that ?
Well we have two objective measures .
Right ? Second , it is negative .
Remember , the deck was stacked against you .
In terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles .
And this can happen in the medical domain .
You were responsible for your decision .
So what do you do ?
You focus on the foregone option .
Right ? A patient in the driver &apos;s seat , for example .
Now , I started off on the somber note .
I want to finish up on a more upbeat note .
Thank you .
And why do I say that ?
The modern car is a sophisticated multi-computer device .
Now , they have two areas they can attack .
Now you might say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s silly . &quot;
They were able to disable the brakes .
All of these were implemented successfully .
You use the GPS in the car to locate it .
Surveillance was really interesting .
Am I scaring you yet ?
It &apos;s more of a two-way radio .
You see the difference ?
It was mostly law enforcement and criminal .
That one &apos;s pretty easy to fix .
And so they had a simple setup .
Don &apos;t waste computer cycles .
It &apos;s the Supreme Court , right ?
So they ran the Pac-Man game .
What does this all mean ?
Thank you very much .
Sarah Kay : If I should have a daughter ...
Believe me , I &apos;ve tried .
Okay , there &apos;s a few heartbreaks that chocolate can &apos;t fix .
That there &apos;ll be days like this .
You will put the star in starting over , and over .
Your voice is small , but don &apos;t ever stop singing .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks .
Thank you .
The only rule is don &apos;t think too hard .
Okay , ready ? Go .
Okay .
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED ?
Because he was out standing in his field .
I &apos;m sorry .
But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding .
So I write poems to figure things out .
Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry .
When I was a freshman in high school , I was a live wire of nervous hormones .
And I was underdeveloped and over-excitable .
So I decided to give it a try .
And lightning struck .
I was hooked .
Step two was the moment I said , &quot; I will . I will continue .
It &apos;s not just the adage &quot; write what you know . &quot;
But it turns out sometimes , poetry can be really scary .
And most people respond really well to this exercise .
I don &apos;t have anything interesting to say . &quot;
And the poem began , &quot; Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man . &quot;
But I try to walk through life like this .
It &apos;s not that I think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form .
But I teach spoken word poetry because it &apos;s accessible .
It &apos;s not enough to just teach that you can express yourself .
Because step three never ends .
I think that we all did .
So I &apos;d like to close with this poem .
She says I have old eyes .
I start quickly becoming part of your past .
And you , you get to share mine .
And that is the greatest present of all .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Miru Kim : My underground art explorations
At the same time , I fell in love with New York City .
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them .
I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them .
The MTA will confiscate your camera . &quot;
I was quite shocked by that , and thought to myself , &quot; Well , OK then .
I &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot;
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .
The construction began in 1837 .
It lasted about five years .
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park .
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful .
This is the same tunnel .
I was basically intruding in his living space .
This is underneath my alma mater , Columbia University .
This children &apos;s hospital was closed in 1997 ; it &apos;s located in Newark .
This is the actual catacombs in Paris .
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
It &apos;s very dangerous to get lost in there .
This is a German bunker .
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques .
It was built in the early 1500s .
It was not very comfortable .
This was probably the toughest place to explore .
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it .
And this is the first theater project I worked on .
Thank you .
Ben Kacyra : Ancient wonders captured in 3D
I &apos;d like to start with a short story .
Let me show you how it works .
All of this happens in seconds .
Ben Kacyra : You can see here , these systems are extremely fast .
They were gone in an instant .
This happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal .
And so this is not a video .
Let me close with another short story .
Last March , we received very sad news .
Our answer , of course , was yes .
Let me leave you with a final thought .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
You can look at it from on top , from the ceiling .
I &apos;d like to thank the wizards here .
David .
Let &apos;s give them a hand .
Thank you .
New thinking on the climate crisis
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism .
How dare we be optimistic ?
And we have one .
To put it in perspective , 2005 was the previous record .
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland .
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .
It &apos;s not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun .
Here &apos;s the stratosphere : cooler .
CSI : Climate .
What is missing is a sense of urgency .
This is the winner .
Fox : two . CNN : two . C zero .
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
But it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
We have the technologies .
People say , &quot; What &apos;s the solution ? &quot; Here it is .
We need to do it for our own economy .
And it is based on an old model .
But geothermal , concentrating solar , advanced photovoltaics , efficiency and conservation .
We now have a culture of distraction .
But we have a planetary emergency .
We have the capacity to do it .
Let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
That hurts .
You have no idea .
Every single debate has been sponsored by &quot; Clean Coal . &quot;
&quot; Now , even lower emissions ! &quot;
Use the Internet . Go on the Internet .
Connect with people . Become very active as citizens .
We need help . We need help .
What &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
So we have to have a change in consciousness .
A change in commitment . A new sense of urgency .
AG : Thank you . Thank you very much .
Amy Cuddy : Your body language shapes who you are
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out .
I see you .
Even the BBC and The New York Times .
What &apos;s mine communicating to you ?
So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
Well , this is what they are .
So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
And humans do the same thing .
They do this .
We do the opposite of them .
They raise their hands like this .
I notice a couple of things about this .
One , you &apos;re not going to be surprised .
It seems to be related to gender .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
They also tend to be able to think more abstractly .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
So here &apos;s one .
A couple more .
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-power poses .
So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
This one is very low-power .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
For numerous reasons , no , no , no , don &apos;t do that .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
They say , &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
Eventually I graduated from college .
I am an impostor .
You are going to fake it .
So she had changed .
So this is two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
I don &apos;t have ego involved in this .
Thank you .
Lee Smolin : Science and democracy
So how does it work ?
And here are some of the ethical principles .
And the idea is that everything is defined .
And they were very closely associated .
In fact , Newton and Locke were friends .
And let me show you .
In a Newtonian universe , there &apos;s no center -- thank you .
And this network of relations is ever-evolving .
They &apos;re thinking about the same things .
So this is the leading killer of women .
Because the personal , as you know , is political .
And not enough is being done about this .
So it &apos;s a woman &apos;s disease now .
I &apos;m going to tell you why .
Heart disease kills people , often very quickly .
Breast cancer , mortality is down to four percent .
And then physicians have gone to bat .
We &apos;ve done the research .
We have effective therapies now .
Women are living longer than ever .
And she wanted to study the Talmud .
She had to impersonate a man .
She had to look like a man .
Mortality is not going down , it &apos;s going up .
And here &apos;s what the story is .
And they &apos;re just passed .
And it funds a lot of my research .
It funds research all over the place .
It told us about hormone replacement therapy .
It &apos;s informed us about osteoporosis .
And our colleagues in Washington , D.C.
Hollywood heart attack . Ughhhh .
Horrible chest pain .
There &apos;s a big clot in the middle of the artery .
That &apos;s a man heart attack .
Right here , it &apos;s just a focal -- right there .
Where do women get fat ?
All over .
And you can see , it &apos;s lumpy bumpy .
She &apos;s just laid it down nice and tidy .
So that was a discovery .
Now what are the implications of that ?
So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging .
We selected this for the research .
And that is microvascular obstruction .
So we &apos;re very excited about M.R.
So those are the consequences .
Why are there women and men ?
That &apos;s all stem cells .
These are female and male stem cells .
Okay , so here &apos;s where we started .
We are bending the curve .
We &apos;re bending the curve .
Now are we happy with this ?
So we &apos;re 35 years behind .
And in fact , it probably won &apos;t .
But we cannot stop now .
Too many lives are at stake .
So what do we need to do ?
And women do fundraising .
Women participate .
And it &apos;s political .
So thank you for your attention .
David Blaine : How I held my breath for 17 minutes
I lived there with nothing but water .
That one was way more difficult than I had expected .
So , next I went to London .
He was underneath , not breathing for 45 minutes .
His core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees .
So , I met with a top neurosurgeon .
So , I took that as a challenge , basically .
So , I realized that was completely not going to work .
&quot; I want to hold my breath for a really long time . How could it be done ? &quot;
This is a little hard to watch .
But this is that attempt .
So , that clearly wasn &apos;t going to work .
There is a chemical that &apos;s called perflubron .
So , that idea disappeared .
Which was another insane idea , obviously .
So , I started researching into pearl divers .
There is many different aspects to free-diving .
And then there is static apnea .
That was the one that I studied .
And I learned how to slow my heart rate down .
And then I learned how to purge .
Purging is basically hyperventilating .
You blow in and out ...
You do that , you get lightheaded , you get tingling .
And you &apos;re really ridding your body of CO2 .
So , when you hold your breath it &apos;s infinitely easier .
At the end of that you &apos;re completely fried , your brain .
You feel like you &apos;re walking around in a daze .
And you have these awful headaches .
I started learning about the world-record holder .
His name is Tom Sietas .
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath .
He &apos;s six foot four . He &apos;s 160 pounds .
And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .
I &apos;m six foot one , and fat .
We &apos;ll say big-boned .
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months .
Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value .
I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day .
And I started to really adapt my body .
Which is lower than most Olympic athletes .
I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere .
I was completely wrong .
And I thought everything seemed to be on track .
This was a critical mistake .
Because of the movement I was wasting oxygen .
By 7 : 08 I started to black out .
I had failed on every level .
So , it &apos;s like base camp Everest .
So , it was a pretty big success .
There was one person there that was definitely not impressed .
Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared .
You know , it was longer than the record .
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it .
So , I started full focus .
And it was right next to the sphere .
Which was making me more nervous .
And there is no way to slow my heart rate down .
I &apos;m going to fail , I &apos;m going to fail . &quot;
And I was getting more nervous .
It was a waste of O2 .
There was no way for me to do it .
So , I started to really get really paranoid .
I started feeling pains all over my chest .
It was awful .
And I started having ischemia to the heart .
It would skip a beat .
It would start . It would stop . And I felt all this .
And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack .
And I didn &apos;t take my head out .
And then suddenly I hear screaming .
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds .
I also didn &apos;t want anybody to question it .
I &apos;m like &quot; Yeah ? &quot;
I was like &quot; What ? &quot;
And that &apos;s my life . So ...
And that &apos;s what magic is to me , so , thank you .
Hans Rosling : Religions and babies
I &apos;m going to talk about religion .
This is a very serious talk .
To what extent are these people right ?
This is a quiz . What do you think ?
Do you think it will decrease to one billion ?
Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century ?
But now , what does religion have to do with it ?
Each country &apos;s a bubble .
The size is the population -- big China , big India here .
And the color now is the majority religion .
That &apos;s where we find Islamic majority .
So we were careful with that .
This is in 1960 .
So low income here , high income there .
The exception was Japan .
Japan here was regarded as an exception .
But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa .
Look at China . They &apos;re falling fairly fast .
It &apos;s a quite amazing development which has happened .
We get that from the census data .
It &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
It has happened across the world .
But there &apos;s no major difference .
There &apos;s no major difference between these religions .
There is a difference with income .
Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa .
It &apos;s the other way around .
These countries have six children per woman .
Congo will go from 60 to 120 .
That &apos;s where we have the fast population growth .
Just look what they have done .
It &apos;s a tremendous improvement .
So what does it take ?
You need to have children to survive .
You need to have access to some family planning .
Look at Bangladesh and Qatar .
And what is the reason in Qatar ?
Well I do as I always do .
Very interesting . Lots to read .
I found fertility at birth , and I looked at total fertility rate per woman .
Now look again at this .
There are countries up here which are very poor .
We have reached peak child .
The number of children is not growing any longer in the world .
And the world population will stop growing .
Well I will show you here .
They are quite useful for educational purposes .
Each card box is one billion people .
And there are two billion children in the world .
There are two billion young people between 15 and 30 .
These are rounded numbers .
And then it &apos;s my box .
This is me : 60-plus .
We are here on top .
So what will happen now is quite straightforward .
The old , sadly , we will die .
Then the old will die .
This is the great fill-up .
It &apos;s inevitable .
That is needed .
Thank you very much .
Joel Levine : Why we need to go back to Mars
That &apos;s 300 million years per minute .
This is fly-by , Mariner IV .
It was taken in 1965 .
And yes , the red planet is red .
We know a lot about Mars .
Mars has the Grand Canyon of the solar system , Valles Marineris .
Very , very interesting planet .
This is 2,000 miles across .
This is Olympus Mons .
This is bigger than the state of Arizona .
We call this crustal magnetism .
Is there water on Mars ?
Today Mars is very very dry .
Here are some recent images .
This is from Spirit and Opportunity .
So , this is frozen water .
This is ice water on Mars .
It has not been seen publicly .
Very intriguing photograph .
Where did the ocean &apos;s worth of water on Mars go ?
Well , we have an idea .
So , there is a lot of water below the surface .
Why is methane important ?
These are the three plumes : A , B1 , B2 .
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion .
That record exists on Mars .
It was a Tuesday .
Here is Viking I , Viking II .
This is Opportunity . This is Spirit .
There aren &apos;t many craters .
But look in the southern hemisphere .
We asked this question 10 years ago .
It &apos;s an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor .
There &apos;s a model of ARES here .
This is a 20-percent scale model .
This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center .
We fly about a mile above the surface .
We preprogram it .
We will fly where the methane is .
How do we transport an airplane to Mars ?
In two words , very carefully .
How do we get it to Mars ?
And we have it in something called an aeroshell .
This is how we do it .
And we have a little video that describes the sequence .
Seven , six . Green board . Five , four , three , two , one .
Main engine start , and liftoff .
This is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to Mars .
It enters the atmosphere of Mars .
A parachute opens up to slow it down .
The thermal tiles fall off .
The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time .
It unfolds .
The rocket engine begins .
Practice makes perfect .
How do we know we can do it ?
We do our tests at 100,000 feet .
This is a half-scale model .
This is a high-altitude helium balloon .
This is over Tilamook , Oregon .
We &apos;re ready to go .
I have a scale model here .
There &apos;s actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing .
Thank you very much .
Yann Arthus-Bertrand : A wide-angle view of fragile Earth
So what do I have to do ?
Alberta sand oil , a lot of pollution .
We know about the end of oil .
Oil sand is not a long-term solution .
We don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
Deny .
Coral reef in New Caledonia .
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago .
There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice .
Sad picture .
It lost 80 percent of its ice .
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth .
Return of fish men .
One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live .
Today now 70 percent of the fish stock are over-exploited .
We don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
One billion people have not enough to eat .
Palm tree plantation in Borneo .
Refugee camp in Darfur .
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world .
We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities .
Landscape was not enough .
It was obvious to me to do another work .
I launched a project named Six Billion Others .
We have done five thousand interviews .
I &apos;m going to show you this .
You &apos;re asking me a hard question .
Fifth The first thing I remember ...
I feel ashamed .
And I feel humbled by their strength .
My family ... What can I say ?
I don &apos;t want them to spend their whole lives in poverty .
Thank you .
I got the easy part .
You come from elsewhere .
You don &apos;t know me . I don &apos;t know you .
We talk without lying .
How can we make it all by ourselves ?
Y You can also go to the website , answer -- respond to the questions also .
Forty crucial questions .
The name of the movie is &quot; Home &quot; -- &quot; Maison . &quot;
It is about the state of the planet .
It &apos;s a fantastic story of life on the earth .
I &apos;m very proud to show you the teaser .
This Earth is four and a half billion years old .
These plants , several hundred million years old .
We &apos;ve managed to adapt , and have conquered the whole planet .
We depend on water , forests , deserts , oceans .
Half of the world &apos;s forests have vanished .
Water resources are running low .
Intensive farming is depleting soils .
Our energy sources are not sustainable .
The climate is changing .
We are endangering ourselves .
We &apos;re only trying to improve our lives .
But the wealth gaps are growing wider .
We know that solutions are available today .
So what are we waiting for ?
Y Luc Besson is the producer of the movie .
But it is not a normal movie .
The film is going to be distributed free .
This film has no copyright .
There is no business on this movie .
We have to believe what we know .
Let me tell you something .
It &apos;s too late to be pessimistic -- really too late .
We have all a part of the solutions .
Merci beaucoup . I love you .
Benjamin Zander : The transformative power of classical music
And one of them wrote , &quot; Situation hopeless . Stop .
They don &apos;t wear shoes . &quot;
And the other one wrote , &quot; Glorious opportunity .
They don &apos;t have any shoes yet . &quot;
He sounds something like this .
At that point , they usually give up .
What actually happened was the impulses were reduced .
And the second , with an impulse every other note .
You can see it by looking at my head .
The nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes .
And the 10-year-old , on every eight notes .
It can be the other buttock .
He was the president of a corporation in Ohio .
You should be a one-buttock player . &quot;
And suddenly , the music took off . It took flight .
There was a gasp in the audience when they heard the difference .
And then I got a letter from this gentleman .
He said , &quot; I was so moved .
There are 1,600 people , I believe .
And your children are playing instruments .
You can &apos;t imagine your life without classical music .
That &apos;s the first group ; it &apos;s quite a small group .
Then there &apos;s another group , bigger group .
These are the people who don &apos;t mind classical music .
That &apos;s the second group .
Now comes the third group .
These are the people who never listen to classical music .
That &apos;s probably the largest group of all .
And then there &apos;s a very small group .
These are the people who think they &apos;re tone-deaf .
You have a fantastic ear . Everybody has a fantastic ear .
So nobody is tone-deaf .
So he does it again .
Now , he tries E again . That chord doesn &apos;t work .
Now , he tries the E again . That chord doesn &apos;t work .
Now , he tries E again , and that doesn &apos;t work .
And then finally ...
Almost goes to E , but otherwise the play would be over .
It &apos;s the wrong chord . It &apos;s the wrong chord . It &apos;s the wrong chord .
And finally goes to E , and it &apos;s home .
And I &apos;ve one last request before I play this piece all the way through .
I was clapping . They were clapping .
Finally , I said , &quot; Why am I clapping ? &quot;
And one of the little kids said , &quot; Because we were listening . &quot;
Now that is something .
And I felt the tears streaming down my face .
They say three percent of the population likes classical music .
How would you talk ? How would you be ?
The conductor of an orchestra doesn &apos;t make a sound .
If the eyes are not shining , you get to ask a question .
We can do that with our children , too .
That &apos;s a totally different world .
For me , it &apos;s very simple . It &apos;s not about wealth and fame and power .
And so when she came out of Auschwitz , she made a vow .
Shining eyes , shining eyes .
Thank you , thank you .
Charles Leadbeater : Education innovation in the slums
It &apos;s a great pleasure to be here .
What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider ?
Where is the Small Hadron Collider ?
The whole Hadron Collider family needs unlocking .
So I ended up in places like this .
This is a place called Monkey Hill .
This is a guy called Juanderson .
It was boring .
He was turning over 200,000 dollars a week .
He employed 200 people .
He was going to be dead by the age of 25 .
They just finished their Kenyan certificate of secondary education .
They &apos;re places like this .
That &apos;s where Maureen went to school .
And the education they got was pitiful .
It &apos;s not to do with electricity or water .
It &apos;s the mobile phone .
Ten years ago , they certainly would have been married .
This is a private school .
The reason they went on studying was this .
Those girls have never touched Google .
They know nothing about Wikipedia .
What do they look like ?
Well , education is a global religion .
You can go to places like this .
Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate .
Many of them don &apos;t have electricity at home .
Most of our education system is push .
I was literally pushed to school .
That isn &apos;t really going to attract him .
You need to pull him .
What does that ?
That &apos;s too long if you &apos;re poor .
And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting .
These things , they teach through .
Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning .
Masses of peer learning .
Well , you create your own teachers .
Pune has 5,000 building sites .
It has 30,000 children on those building sites .
That &apos;s one city .
So I met this character , Steven .
Here , there isn &apos;t really an option .
Learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense .
It &apos;s the largest NGO in education in the world .
He &apos;s a complete revolutionary .
You should turn it into McDonald &apos;s .
And it &apos;s the same wherever you go .
And there will be no mistakes . &quot;
Why can &apos;t we do it more like the Chinese restaurants ? &quot;
Yet , everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant .
The McDonald &apos;s model scales .
The Chinese restaurant model spreads .
They often hit their target but miss the point .
There are two basic types of innovation .
We need more reinvention .
There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia .
There are Kunskapsskolan schools in Sweden .
So we certainly need more of that .
You need efforts to supplement schools .
It &apos;s an amazing thing .
It &apos;s recognizably 19th century in its roots .
And of course it &apos;s a huge achievement .
And of course it will bring great things .
But it will also lay waste to imagination .
Thank you .
Dean Kamen : Luke , a new prosthetic arm for soldiers
Whole arm . Shoulder disarticulation .
And they deserve more than that . &quot;
And it can &apos;t be done .
That &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot;
We put this thing together .
We showed it to a bunch of guys .
This weighs 6.9 pounds .
Going to scratch his nose .
It &apos;s got 14 active degrees of freedom .
They don &apos;t give any instructions .
Ants interact using smell .
All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants .
And all of these interactions , taken together , produce a network .
And another environmental challenge is resources , finding them and collecting them .
So interactions function to activate foragers .
And we &apos;ve been studying the evolution of this system .
First of all , there &apos;s variation .
It turns out that colonies are different .
So then I was able to ask , okay , who &apos;s doing better ?
She &apos;s a matriarch .
She &apos;s one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site .
And guess what we call this analogy ?
The anternet is coming .
So what happens when operating costs are low ?
So here &apos;s an example of ant security .
We &apos;re still analyzing the data .
I don &apos;t have the results yet .
It &apos;s very simple .
It can be done with cheap materials .
There are many different kinds of cancer .
We have a lot to learn from them .
Thank you .
John Hockenberry : We are all designers
It should imagine a user .
That &apos;s what he said .
And design was in everything my dad did .
And he said , &quot; No , never , John , never .
It &apos;s where we all belong . &quot;
All of us ? Designers ?
Oh , oh , Dad . Oh , Dad .
The song is just a given .
It &apos;s how you cover it that matters .
Well , let &apos;s hold on to that thought for just a minute .
The original tune ? It &apos;s a little scary .
&quot; Ooh , what happened to that dude ?
Anybody ? &quot;
My life , at the mercy of good design and bad design .
I roll swiftly through an airport , right ?
Or I &apos;d dress up really , really sharply or something .
I mean , how important could you be then ? &quot; they said .
Look at that !
I guess they &apos;re for safety , right ? &quot;
No ! They &apos;re not for safety .
No , no , no , no , no .
The difference is intent .
That &apos;s right , that &apos;s right ; I &apos;m no longer a victim .
Intent changes the picture completely .
Acting with intent .
It conveys authorship .
It suggests that someone is driving .
It &apos;s reassuring ; people are drawn to it .
Someone making the experience their own .
People respond to that .
It &apos;s a completely different domain .
He &apos;s something very , very different .
We &apos;re supposed to act with intent .
We &apos;re supposed to do things by design .
Intent is a marker for civilization .
Well !
What a liberating thought ! Yes !
No , I don &apos;t think a designer did come up with that .
In fact , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
And so , little Ajax was born .
It &apos;s something like my accident , right ?
He came out of nowhere .
We &apos;re five now . Five .
Facing the given with intent . Doing things by design .
Man , I love that thing .
I could afford that .
Well , got that wrong , didn &apos;t we ?
What was going on then ?
Human life needed a reason .
Reality itself needed a designer .
Gods we &apos;re still fighting about . Oh yeah .
Today we don &apos;t confront the chaos of nature .
What shall we do ?
The consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting .
And we can &apos;t just imitate the past . No .
That won &apos;t do .
That won &apos;t do at all .
And I didn &apos;t look like a soldier , that &apos;s for sure .
He goes , &quot; Hey , mister ! Mister ! &quot;
My machine : American-made , confident , sleek .
Design blew it all away for a moment .
And I pose this question .
You &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
&quot; Nurse ! Is this the 28th or the 29th ? &quot;
And I went , &quot; Oh my God .
I &apos;ve got some catching up to do ! &quot;
There &apos;s the former Soviet megalomaniacs .
Saparmurat Niyazov , he was one of them .
He was a slightly unusual guy .
There &apos;s Teodorín Obiang .
And there &apos;s Dan Etete .
But does it just happen over there ?
Well , at 22 , I was very lucky .
And it was a slightly crazy place .
He did business with global banks .
He used shell companies .
And then there &apos;s Dan Etete .
Now let &apos;s take the banks first .
For example , in Sarawak , Malaysia .
So how did that happen ?
And then there &apos;s the problem of anonymous shell companies .
Okay , maybe it &apos;s a bit of a cliché to talk about them .
Well , because there &apos;s a lot at stake .
Now , on the surface , the deal appeared straightforward .
Now , that &apos;s not bad going for a convicted money launderer .
And here &apos;s the thing .
It &apos;s too complex and difficult to change .
So this is change happening .
This is progress .
But we &apos;re not there yet , by far .
Thank you .
Kwabena Boahen : A computer that works like the brain
And I was fascinated .
But nobody was really worried about this .
Let &apos;s take a look at some numbers .
This is Blue Gene , the fastest computer in the world .
It would really boost the economy .
That &apos;s how much power this computer uses .
Now , let &apos;s compare this with the brain .
This is a picture of , actually Rory Sayres &apos; girlfriend &apos;s brain .
Rory is a graduate student at Stanford .
So that &apos;s true love , right there .
How is the brain able to do this ?
It shows you these cells that process information .
They are called neurons .
That process is called a synapse .
How does that compare with the way computers work ?
It &apos;s really a network in the literal sense of the word .
The net is doing the work in the brain .
And this is a little protein molecule .
Now , this pore can open and close .
you get some current sometimes .
Now , this is starting to happen in transistors .
And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel .
It makes the brain inherently robust .
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information .
And then it also extracts movement .
And so , here you go .
Yes , so that &apos;s the idea .
Thank you .
Question for you , Kwabena .
It was very brute force ; it was very inelegant .
Thanks Kwabena , that was really interesting .
Thank you .
David Griffin : How photography connects us
Oh , the wrath of Photoshop .
He mounted a camera on the tail .
Pygmies in the DRC , by Randy Olson .
But , hey , at least it &apos;s hygienic .
Here &apos;s an example .
I can see the rocks are over here .
There &apos;s a wave about to crash onto him .
We got back on shore ; he was fine .
We were a little bit rattled .
I thought I was a hero .
You &apos;ve got to be able to make them all the time .
But even more importantly , you need to know how to create a visual narrative .
You need to know how to tell a story .
And that is what Nick did , up to a point .
This is a serval cat .
These are baboons at a watering hole .
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den .
But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants .
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted .
And that &apos;s when they ran into trouble .
And they only came for the ivory .
This is actually one of the rangers .
Now let &apos;s go over to India .
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way .
Let &apos;s go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world . &quot;
And he did it in a beautiful way .
And here in China , Randy shot a jellyfish market .
We also want to look for solutions .
Jim started in the battlefield .
Here is in the field hospital .
This is sort of the munch of the penguins .
But then Paul got in the water .
And he said he was never really afraid of this .
Well , this one female came up to him .
So , she is pretty significant in size .
Or you know , &quot; My , what big teeth you have . &quot;
Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph .
Thank you .
And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this .
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds .
We &apos;re just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here .
These are the displacement maps here .
And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates .
So the next process was then to animate her .
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that &apos;s available .
Here is the specular component animating .
You can see all the wrinkles happening there .
And there is the underlying wireframe mesh .
And that is Emily herself .
Now , where are we going with this here ?
And thank you very much .
Gavin Pretor-Pinney : Cloudy with a chance of joy
Clouds .
They get a bad rap .
I saw an article the other day .
It was about problems with computer processing over the Internet .
&quot; A cloud over the cloud , &quot; was the headline .
But I think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
You know , when you were masters of daydreaming ?
I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it .
Let &apos;s say you &apos;re in love . All right ?
And you look up and what do you see ?
Right ? Or maybe the opposite .
Perhaps you &apos;re having a moment of existential angst .
You know , you &apos;re thinking about your own mortality .
And there , on the horizon , it &apos;s the Grim Reaper .
What would that mean ?
What would that mean ? I have no idea .
Let &apos;s start with this one . It &apos;s the cirrus cloud , named after the Latin for a lock of hair .
They can be 200 miles an hour , 300 miles an hour .
It &apos;s like a bit of everyday meditation .
Those are common clouds .
These clouds form in the region of mountains .
A little rarer are the fallstreak holes . All right ?
Rarer still , the Kelvin – Helmholtz cloud .
Not a very snappy name . Needs a rebrand .
And you &apos;ll see them around where you live .
It &apos;s what &apos;s produces thunder and lightning and hail .
They are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere .
We don &apos;t live beneath the sky . We live within it .
Right ? It forms on a sunny day .
And cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing .
It &apos;s good for your ideas . It &apos;s good for your creativity .
It &apos;s good for your soul .
Thank you very much .
I mean , nine years is a long time .
But not all , a few are still alive .
And when I do , it &apos;s as a bit of a know-it-all .
And I can &apos;t complain about this .
And I loved game shows , fascinated with game shows .
I was going to miss my game shows .
And so I sold out way too young .
But that &apos;s what I was doing .
This was the first I &apos;d heard of it .
And of course I said yes , for several reasons .
And I would do it for nothing .
I just love &quot; Jeopardy , &quot; and I always have .
I was not going to say no .
I had taken some artificial intelligence classes .
And I thought , well this is going to be child &apos;s play .
And at first , it was very low .
But then you see the line start to go up .
And thought , what are these ?
And I saw this line coming for me .
And I realized , this is it .
This is what it looks like when the future comes for you .
We were not playing in L.A. on the regular &quot; Jeopardy &quot; set .
Watson does not travel .
Watson &apos;s actually huge .
We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room .
And so Watson does not travel .
There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage .
But they were right . They were exactly right .
And I remember thinking , this is it .
I felt obsolete .
And it hasn &apos;t been the last .
I &apos;m not an economist myself .
And it was friggin &apos; demoralizing . It was terrible .
We &apos;re just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard .
Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less ?
The things we know are still important .
There &apos;s an advantage of volume , and there &apos;s an advantage of time .
The advantage of volume , first , just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays .
There &apos;s so much information out there .
There &apos;s just too much .
It &apos;s doubling every 18 months now .
Who do I vote for ?
Do I take this job or that one ?
Quite probably not .
And you &apos;ll make a less informed decision .
But in this case it happened in real life .
And it happens in real life all the time .
It &apos;s not always a tsunami , often it &apos;s a social situation .
That &apos;s often the advantage of time .
And it &apos;s not effective if you say , &quot; Well , hold on .
You &apos;re from Fargo , North Dakota . Let me see what comes up .
Oh , yeah . Roger Maris was from Fargo . &quot;
That doesn &apos;t work . That &apos;s just annoying .
Those movies are never about beautiful utopias .
Things always go terribly wrong .
And we can all make that choice .
That &apos;s where the people you see on &quot; Jeopardy &quot; come from .
I &apos;ve met a lot of them .
We can live in one of these two worlds .
Ladies and gentlemen , the choice is yours .
Thank you very much .
The truth of the matter is otherwise .
And they said , &quot; Messenger of God , we are battle-weary .
How can we go to a greater battle ? &quot;
The voice says , &quot; Go away . &quot;
With much greater humility , he knocks again on the door .
The voice asks , &quot; Who is there ? &quot;
He said , &quot; It is you , O heartbreaker . &quot;
But don &apos;t ignore what you &apos;ve asked them to do .
We know it all .
We have access to it all .
Jung may have called it &quot; the subconscious . &quot;
The language differs , but the objective is the same .
What is the imagery of God ?
Thank you , and God bless you .
Sherry Turkle : Connected , but alone ?
Her text said , &quot; Mom , you will rock . &quot;
I love this .
And so there you have it .
I embody the central paradox .
And then we unplugged .
I was excited .
Now fast-forward to 2012 .
I &apos;m back here on the TED stage again .
My daughter &apos;s 20 . She &apos;s a college student .
So what happened ?
And we even text at funerals .
I study this .
Why does this matter ?
People want to customize their lives .
I &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t want to be interrupted .
So that &apos;s the bottom line .
Human relationships are rich and they &apos;re messy and they &apos;re demanding .
And we clean them up with technology .
We short-change ourselves .
It seemed to be looking in her eyes .
It seemed to be following the conversation .
It comforted her .
And many people found this amazing .
That robot put on a great show .
And we &apos;re vulnerable .
People experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing .
It doesn &apos;t face death .
It doesn &apos;t know life . &quot;
And we are vulnerable .
We &apos;re lonely , but we &apos;re afraid of intimacy .
But we &apos;re not so comfortable .
We are not so much in control .
Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved .
And so people try to solve it by connecting .
It expresses , but it doesn &apos;t solve , an underlying problem .
It &apos;s shaping a new way of being .
We almost don &apos;t feel ourselves .
We &apos;re smitten with technology .
But it &apos;s time to talk .
But it &apos;s not , it &apos;s early days .
I see some first steps .
Start thinking of solitude as a good thing .
Make room for it .
Do the same thing at work .
Change that .
I &apos;m optimistic .
We have everything we need to start .
We have each other .
It &apos;s like calling in the cavalry .
They need us .
Thank you .
John McWhorter : Txtng is killing language . JK ! ! !
We always hear that texting is a scourge .
What do I mean by that ?
That &apos;s how we use language most .
That &apos;s how much of a latterly thing writing is .
Casual speech is something quite different .
That &apos;s what speech is like .
It &apos;s much less reflective -- very different from writing .
It was perfectly natural .
And so , texting is very loose in its structure .
Now we can write the way we talk .
It &apos;s a very natural sense .
And so , for example , there is in texting a convention , which is LOL .
&quot; I love the font you &apos;re using , btw . &quot;
No one &apos;s laughing .
Susan : &quot; lol , I see it . &quot;
LOL is being used in a very particular way .
It &apos;s a marker of empathy . It &apos;s a marker of accommodation .
It &apos;s a way of using the language between actual people .
Another example is &quot; slash . &quot;
That &apos;s kind of like what we &apos;re at .
It &apos;s used to change the scene .
Sally : &quot; For this summer program at NYU . &quot;
The slash is interesting .
You don &apos;t just zip right into it .
There &apos;s a lack of structure of some sort .
It &apos;s not as sophisticated as the language of The Wall Street Journal .
It &apos;s the President of Harvard . It &apos;s 1871 .
You can go even further back .
That &apos;s also true of being bidialectal .
It &apos;s very simple .
That &apos;d be the second thing .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Yves Behar : A supercharged motorcycle design
Yves Behar : And in scenic Switzerland for me .
FN : I always had a passion for alternative vehicles .
FN : And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions .
We had a lot that got us excited .
So we decided to do a special project together .
To combine engineering and design and ...
FN : Really make a fully integrated product , something beautiful .
YB : And we made a baby .
FN : Can you bring out our baby ?
This baby is fully electric .
It goes 150 miles an hour .
It &apos;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle .
It &apos;s got an amazing user experience .
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar .
YB : Thank you .
Ron McCallum : How technology allowed me to read
I love stories . I want to read . &quot;
I don &apos;t know where Julian Morrow got that from .
Look for it . Have you noticed it ?
I do . I look for it all the time .
How very wrong I was .
See it up there ?
And you see it has no , what do you call it , no screen .
It &apos;s a blind computer .
It had a speech synthesizer .
I didn &apos;t have to be nice to people !
I no longer would be censored .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s shrunk to .
I can keep up with my friends .
Ron McCallum : Isn &apos;t that slow ?
I slowed it down for you .
Can we play that one ?
Do you love being read to ?
Isn &apos;t that a great book ?
I still love being close to someone reading to me .
But those books can &apos;t travel across borders .
In Argentina , there are 50,000 .
And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter .
I want that to happen .
I &apos;ve indeed been a very fortunate human being .
I wonder what the future will hold .
I want to thank her too .
I think I have to say goodbye now .
Bless you . Thank you very much .
Yay !
Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay .
Nicholas Christakis : How social networks predict epidemics
And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance .
And you get a network that looks like this .
Every dot is a person .
And eventually , you saturate the population .
But things don &apos;t just diffuse in human populations at random .
They actually diffuse through networks .
And there are different kinds of relationships between the people .
But not all positions in the network are the same .
But in addition , there &apos;s something else .
Nicholas Christakis : B , it &apos;s obvious .
B is located on the edge of the network .
And this , in essence , is what &apos;s known as the friendship paradox .
And that happens at every peripheral node .
Exactly what we predicted happened .
So the random group is in the red line .
And the difference in the two is 16 days .
I should say that depends on a host of factors .
And in a minute now , I &apos;m going to put this map into motion .
You &apos;re going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle .
Here we are on October the 19th .
They are surrounded by immunized people .
So 96 percent is as good as 100 percent .
And the answer is no .
Or , frankly , for advertising with all kinds of products .
Just text us your temperature . &quot;
Thank you .
We &apos;re moving .
When the person in front of me slows down .
We &apos;re going to do working memory today .
You &apos;re going it right now .
So right now , you &apos;re doing just fine .
Now working memory has four basic components .
They &apos;re able to have high levels of writing ability .
They &apos;re also able to reason at high levels .
You up for that ? Okay .
Five words .
So far so good ?
Just shout it out .
In fact it &apos;s -- -- exactly .
You should have started with Z.
Some people can hang on to five .
Some people can hang on to 10 .
Some will be down to two or three .
It allows us to make sense of the world around us .
But it does have certain limits .
It allows us to problem-solve , critical think .
All of that occurs within working memory .
We tend to remember about four things .
You do know the solution to that , right ?
You go back to that original room .
Have you ever forgotten your keys ?
You ever forgotten your car ?
You ever forgotten your kids ?
We negotiate that through strategies .
What &apos;s missing ? What would I like to know ?
Do I agree with the assumptions ?
Now we also need to repeat it . We need to practice .
So we need to think about it here .
Practice for some reason became a very negative thing .
It &apos;s very positive .
What we want to do is spin that around .
We need to take advantage of that .
Think about things in images , write things down that way .
If you read a book , pull things up .
The last one is organization and support .
We try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us .
And the last one is support .
We all started as novices .
Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication .
If we &apos;re not processing life , we &apos;re not living it .
Live life . Thank you .
We all know that it &apos;s Bill .
And in this case , the stereotype corresponds to reality .
This trait also tells us a lot about politics .
So here &apos;s the description of a group I found on the Web .
This is from some guy named Ted .
Let &apos;s find out .
Please raise your hand high right now . OK .
OK , about a -- two dozen .
OK . This is a bit of a problem .
So anyway , let &apos;s go with the red pill .
Let &apos;s start at the beginning .
What is morality and where does it come from ?
Nature provides a first draft , which experience then revises .
What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines ?
The first one is harm / care .
The second foundation is fairness / reciprocity .
The third foundation is in-group / loyalty .
Sports is to war as pornography is to sex .
We get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives .
The fourth foundation is authority / respect .
The fifth foundation is purity / sanctity .
Here are the results .
Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens .
Same story for fairness .
But look at the other three lines .
For liberals , the scores are very low .
But as people get more conservative , the values rise .
We find this in every country we look at .
Here &apos;s the data for 1,100 Canadians .
I &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
Because liberals like to say , &quot; Fetch , please . &quot;
What makes them moral ?
In the first panel , we see the moment of creation .
But then , given the way of the world , things change .
Of course , Bosch called this hell .
The truth of social entropy .
It shoots up and it keeps going up .
It really helps to have some sort of punishment .
The Grand Canyon is really simple .
It &apos;s not that complicated .
How did this happen ?
Because liberals reject three of these foundations .
They say , &quot; Let &apos;s question authority . &quot;
Conservatives , on the other hand , speak for institutions and traditions .
The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve .
It &apos;s really precious , and it &apos;s really easy to lose .
This was after the chaos of the French Revolution .
Think about yin and yang .
You find the same thing in Hinduism .
There are many high gods in Hinduism .
You find the same thing in Buddhism .
So , what &apos;s the point ? What should you do ?
No , absolutely not . I &apos;m not saying that .
Step out .
Think about the Dalai Lama .
But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth .
Thank you .
What is so special about the human brain ?
But let &apos;s play along .
It seems quite vexing .
It must be really extraordinary , an exception to the rule .
And this is where the story started to bother me .
But nobody did .
Well , what about our brain then ?
That &apos;s not possible .
The human brain is not a large rat brain .
And all of you are primates .
And so was Darwin .
Why does it cost so much energy , then ?
So we did the math .
What about us ?
So what is the human advantage ?
In two words , we cook .
No other animal cooks its food . Only humans do .
Thank you very much .
Philip Zimbardo : The psychology of time
All right , start the clock please . 30 seconds studio .
Keep it quiet please . Settle down .
It &apos;s about time . End sequence . Take one .
15 seconds studio .
&quot; One bite , Adam . Don &apos;t abandon Eve . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know , guys .
I don &apos;t want to get in trouble . &quot;
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment .
So much for promises .
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT .
And you do it automatically and non-consciously .
What determines any decision you make ?
You make a decision on which you &apos;re going to base an action .
For others , the present is irrelevant .
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences .
Cost-benefit analysis .
You can focus on past-positive , or past-negative .
You can be future-oriented , setting goals .
So , very quickly , what is the optimal time profile ?
High on past-positive . Moderately high on future .
And moderate on present-hedonism .
And always low on past-negative and present-fatalism .
What do futures sacrifice for success ?
They sacrifice fun time . They sacrifice personal indulgence .
And they live for work , achievement and control .
Thank you so much .
Becky Blanton : The year I was homeless
His death hit me pretty hard .
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that .
At first , living in the van was great .
I showered in campgrounds . I ate out regularly .
And I had time to relax and to grieve .
What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer .
The doggy went into doggy day care .
And I sweated .
Or I washed up in public rest rooms .
Food rotted in the heat .
And I faced a whole new set of challenges .
I didn &apos;t always succeed .
I hadn &apos;t changed . My I.Q. hadn &apos;t dropped .
But I had changed somehow .
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression .
I just wasn &apos;t drunk or high .
The real homeless don &apos;t have hope . &quot;
You should too .
And I cried .
Because I was a writer .
I was a writer .
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee .
And I started writing again .
I was no longer homeless .
And I was no longer invisible .
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope .
Béatrice Coron : Stories cut from paper
I am a papercutter .
I cut stories .
So my process is very straightforward .
So I didn &apos;t come to papercutting in a straight line .
In fact , I see it more as a spiral .
But I was also a rebel .
I moved for two years in Taiwan .
So artist books have a lot of definitions .
They come in a lot of different shapes .
They can be with words or without words .
I love oddities of languages .
And my daily language is English .
So one of these works is the &quot; Spelling Spider . &quot;
So the Spelling Spider is a cousin of the spelling bee .
But it &apos;s much more connected to the Web .
It &apos;s to have a look at different worlds .
And very often I &apos;ve been an outsider .
It &apos;s all if .
It would be so light .
And we can use them also as a safety net .
And my inspirations are very eclectic .
Other ones are historical .
Here it &apos;s &quot; CandyCity . &quot;
I call them Freudian cities .
&quot; ModiCity . &quot;
&quot; ElectriCity . &quot;
&quot; MAD Growth on Columbus Circle . &quot;
&quot; ReefCity . &quot;
&quot; A Web of Time . &quot;
&quot; Chaos City . &quot;
&quot; Daily Battles . &quot;
&quot; FeliCity . &quot;
&quot; Floating Islands . &quot;
One story leads to another .
Then I went to run 50K , then 60K .
Then I ran 50 miles -- ultramarathons .
And running gives me a lot of energy .
The result is &quot; Hells and Heavens . &quot;
It &apos;s two panels 13 ft. high .
That &apos;s the border .
You have sweatshops in hells .
So you can take it off the wall .
It &apos;s not autobiographical identities .
They are more our social identities .
And then you can just walk behind them and try them on .
That &apos;s another artist book project .
In fact , in the picture , you have two of them .
Why do I call it a book ?
So artist books , you take them off the wall .
You take them for a walk .
So it &apos;s regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind .
I love public art .
I called it &quot; Working in the Same Direction . &quot;
With public art , I could also make cut glass .
Here it &apos;s faceted glass in the Bronx .
It is travel in time , travel on time .
And it &apos;s still growing .
I also planted the bibliotree .
And it &apos;s all about international writing systems .
So in Aurora , Colorado it &apos;s a bench .
But you have a bonus with this bench .
And it &apos;s called &quot; Seeds of the Future are Planted Today . &quot;
So each building has its own personality .
It &apos;s called Rue des Prairies -- Prairie Street .
So that was a very captive audience .
And I wanted to give them an escape .
I created &quot; All Around Town . &quot;
So the stories , they have a lot of possibilities .
They have a lot of scenarios .
I don &apos;t know the stories .
Sergey Brin + Larry Page : The genesis of Google
We spoke to you last several years ago .
Now I hope all of you feel better .
Audience : Yes .
SB : What is it ?
But this is what helped me see it .
Here it &apos;s slightly logged .
And they &apos;re labeled by color right now , by language .
There we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right .
You can see that Japan is busy at night , right there .
We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese .
There &apos;s a lot of activity in China .
There &apos;s a lot of activity in India .
There &apos;s some in the Middle East , the little pockets .
You can see that there &apos;s a lot of data running around .
So this is slowed down .
This is what one second looks like .
You can see that it got started right here .
But it didn &apos;t have quite the same pickup in the U.S.
as it did in Spain .
And I just wanted to play it for you .
Now does anybody know who this is ?
A-ha !
Audience : Orkut .
SB : Yes ! Somebody got it .
Do we have any ?
Okay , not very many people know about it .
I &apos;ll explain it in a second .
This is one of our engineers .
That &apos;s how we churn those products out .
So this is what he built .
This is our VP of Engineering .
And these are all of his friends .
And now we &apos;ve grown to over 100,000 members .
So it &apos;s a fun little project .
And -- well , I &apos;ll leave you in suspense .
Larry Page : Thank you , Sergey .
And he just -- he -- after 9 / 11 , he got really interested in the news .
and they would try to make a product .
Don &apos;t really pay attention to them .
And the top thing , actually , is the Deskbar .
So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar ?
Raise your hands .
How many of you use the Deskbar ?
And it &apos;s sort of like a better version of the toolbar .
Thank you , Sergey .
This is actually our &quot; cult picture . &quot;
I just wanted to show quickly .
And I think we &apos;ve done a good job encouraging that .
It makes it a really fun place to work .
You want it to be consistent .
And we said , &quot; Well , that doesn &apos;t sound so much fun .
Why don &apos;t we try changing it every day ? &quot;
And , you know , thank you .
I don &apos;t have to do my other job now . &quot;
And in fact , the ultimate search engine would be smart .
It would be artificial intelligence .
Maybe , Sergey , you can highlight this .
He was just kind of writing about his life .
Why don &apos;t they like my blog ? &quot;
And then we produced &quot; You suck . &quot;
And finally , it ended with &quot; Kiss my ass . &quot;
And that &apos;s unlike many of our competitors .
So thank you .
Some of those reforms have been good .
Some of them have been not so good .
And we know why kids drop out .
We know why kids don &apos;t learn .
For years , I have watched people teach .
They pay me to teach a lesson .
The kids should learn it .
I should teach it . They should learn it . Case closed . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s just a bunch of hooey . &quot;
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea .
You ever thought about that ?
I taught a lesson once on ratios .
I &apos;d taught the whole lesson wrong .
They said , &quot; That &apos;s okay , Ms. Pierson .
You were so excited , we just let you go . &quot;
And it was difficult . It was awfully hard .
One year I came up with a bright idea .
One of the students said , &quot; Really ? &quot;
You just have to strut . &quot;
I am powerful , and I am strong .
And they said , &quot; Yeah ! &quot;
And so — I gave a quiz , 20 questions .
A student missed 18 .
I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
He said , &quot; Then why &apos;d you put a smiley face ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Because you &apos;re on a roll .
You see , &quot; -18 &quot; sucks all the life out of you .
See , it &apos;s hard to teach kids who stink .
And kids can be cruel .
You made it work for me .
Can we stand to have more relationships ? Absolutely .
And you know your toughest kids are never absent .
It &apos;s the connection . It &apos;s the relationships .
Teaching and learning should bring joy .
But it is not impossible .
We &apos;re born to make a difference .
Thank you so much .
And they are not magnanimous in victory .
I could accept that .
And of course , they were right .
All of these things .
Now , sunlight , of course , comes into this .
I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil .
And it is , to prevent rickets and so on .
It &apos;s not the only reason preventing heart disease .
It arises in the skin .
How do you have low blood pressure in your skin ?
It &apos;s not the heart . What do you do ?
And I was interested in these really complex systems .
And I then moved back to Edinburgh .
So they &apos;re really an ideal model .
So these are kind of sunlamps .
Now , we &apos;re still collecting data .
I &apos;m not sure exactly how much .
This is separate from vitamin D.
But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.
That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle .
So Ventura is in southern California .
In summer , you might as well be at the equator .
It &apos;s great . Lots of NO is released .
So what do we think ?
We think it &apos;s very important .
So , thank you very much indeed .
And I couldn &apos;t get this information out .
I ran the Camden Police Department because of that .
We have no suspects . &quot;
We weren &apos;t using data-driven policing .
So I wanted to do things differently .
In short , I wanted to moneyball criminal justice .
We also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions .
We have 12 million arrests every single year .
They haven &apos;t yet been convicted of a crime .
They &apos;re just waiting for their day in court .
And 67 percent of people come back .
It impacts everything .
It impacts sentencing .
It impacts crime and violence .
They mean it and they believe it .
And it looks like this .
And with this tool , we can predict three things .
And third , we can predict whether someone will come back to court .
Now I want to say something really important .
I don &apos;t .
Some people call it data science .
I call it moneyballing criminal justice .
Thank you .
Stefano Mancuso : The roots of plant intelligence
Sometimes I go browsing &#91; through &#93; a very old magazine .
Some of them are very easy .
Some of them are about the animals , the number .
And this problem is : where are the plants ?
Why ?
This is not the common man .
The &quot; Homo studiosus &quot; -- the studying man .
But it &apos;s something completely wrong .
You know very well about professors .
Let &apos;s have a look at this short movie now .
We have David Attenborough .
They have just a kind of very low-level soul .
Let &apos;s see .
This is a very fast movement .
But plants are also able to show a lot of movement .
Some of them are very well known , like the flowering .
Some of them are much more sophisticated .
They are also able to play -- they are really playing .
But they are also able to sleep .
This is one , Mimosa pudica .
It &apos;s the same in plants , in insects and in animals .
It &apos;s a kind of vegetarian experimentation .
They communicate with other plants .
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin .
This is a serious business .
The title is &quot; The Power of Movement in Plants . &quot;
This is not a metaphor .
Now , this is a root apex growing against a slope .
And this region , it &apos;s a very small region -- it &apos;s less than one millimeter .
We have almost 14 million roots .
They work in the same way .
And why are they so similar ?
They work in the same way .
And another possibility is a technological possibility .
We have the androids that are inspired by man .
But why have we not any plantoid ?
It &apos;s much more easy to build hybrids .
They have computing power , they have electrical signals .
Well , thank you for your attention .
Thank you .
Liu Bolin : The invisible man
This work is called Xia Gang .
This piece is called The Studio .
Kenny Scharf &apos;s graffiti .
This is Venice , Italy .
This is the ancient city of Pompeii .
Interpreter : This is the ancient city of Pompeii .
LB : This is the Borghese Gallery in Rome .
For instance , why would I make myself invisible ?
This one is called Instant Noodles .
Interpreter : This one is called Instant Noodles .
These phosphors can even cause cancer .
There is no Photoshop involved .
There is no Photoshop involved .
That &apos;s all I want to say .
Thank you .
Yossi Vardi : We &apos;re worried about local warming ... in your lap
This message is given as a public service .
Global warming fun .
But let &apos;s keep things in proportion .
You should stay cool with the appropriate clothing .
You are great . This is the correct posture .
Digital scrotum , digital media .
And this is what the young generation says .
4 am in the morning .
You cannot use this picture .
Joe Smith : How to use a paper towel
We can do that .
Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers .
People go one , two , three , four , tear .
This much , right ?
There &apos;s the one that cuts itself .
People go , one , two , three , four .
Let &apos;s hear it . Shake . Louder .
Audience : Shake .
Joe Smith : Your word is &quot; fold . &quot;
Audience : Fold .
JS : Again .
Audience : Fold . JS : Really loud .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
JS : Okay . Wet hands .
Tri-fold . Fold ...
Dry .
Audience : Shake .
Fold .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
JS : Cuts itself .
If you think this isn &apos;t as good ...
Audience : Shake . Fold .
It &apos;s way too big a towel .
Let me tell you a secret .
It &apos;s smart enough to stop .
And you get half a towel .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
JS : Now , let &apos;s all say it together . Shake . Fold .
And next year , toilet paper .
Michael Sandel : The lost art of democratic debate
I have a suggestion .
So , are you ready for the lecture ?
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lecture .
Now , you may say , well , that &apos;s obvious enough .
Take the example of flutes .
Suppose we &apos;re distributing flutes .
Who should get the best ones ?
Let &apos;s see what people -- What would you say ?
Who should get the best flute ?
You can just call it out .
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
Who else ?
The best flute players .
The worst flute players .
How many say the best flute players ?
Why ?
Actually , that was Aristotle &apos;s answer too .
But here &apos;s a harder question .
Peter : The greatest benefit to all .
The greatest benefit to all .
That &apos;s Peter ?
All right .
Well , it &apos;s a good reason .
That &apos;s all right .
It had to do with golf .
In fact , it carried risk of injury .
They said , &quot; No .
Now that would give you an unfair advantage . &quot;
He says , &quot; I &apos;m a great golfer .
I want to compete .
Suppose you were on the Supreme Court .
Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case .
All right , let &apos;s take a poll , show of hands .
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin ?
All right , we have a good division of opinion here .
What would be your reason ?
How would you answer the objection ?
Yes , all right .
What &apos;s your name ?
Walking the course is not part of the game of golf ?
Charlie : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t .
All right . Stay there , Charlie .
Who has an answer for Charlie ?
All right , who has an answer for Charlie ?
What would you say ?
Walking all those holes ?
That &apos;s part of the game of golf ?
What &apos;s your name ?
Warren .
Charlie , what do you say to Warren ?
Charley : I &apos;ll stick to my original thesis .
Warren , are you a golfer ?
Warren : I am not a golfer .
Charley : And I am .
You know , it &apos;s interesting .
Is walking the course essential to the game ?
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer .
And what do you suppose they all said ?
Yes . They agreed with Warren .
They said , yes , walking the course is strenuous physical exercise .
The Supreme Court decided .
What do you suppose they said ?
Seven to two , they ruled .
And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
It &apos;s also objectionable on a second ground .
What would it be ?
Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to .
Then the fairness objection goes away .
Why ?
That &apos;s really what marriage is about .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thanks . Thank you .
Chris .
Thanks , Chris .
What &apos;s your vision for the next phase of this ?
Well , I think that it is possible .
That &apos;s what I would love to do .
Michael Sandel . Thank you so much .
Vikram Patel : Mental health for all by involving all
I want you to imagine this for a moment .
Rajiv suffers from a mental illness .
I see some nodding heads there .
In India , I found the situation was not a lot better .
In reality , take a guess .
Shea Hembrey : How I became 100 artists
But on the other side of that , though , we were big readers in our house .
So I should talk about art .
I &apos;m just going to make the whole thing myself .
And so this is what I did .
It &apos;s going to be two years of studio work .
So I should start to talk about these guys .
Well the range is quite a bit .
This isn &apos;t Photoshopped .
This is Nell Remmel .
And this is 22 feet long .
And I love to dig a hole .
And she &apos;s making weather on her body &apos;s scale .
And this piece is &quot; Frost . &quot;
The sun rises , and it melts away .
And that was played by my mom .
One of these is scratch-off masterpieces .
He draws sticks real good . &quot;
Which is one of the best compliments ever .
For this family , he made this still-life painting .
This project is called &quot; Love Nests . &quot;
And this one &apos;s called &quot; Lovelock &apos;s Nest . &quot;
And this one &apos;s called &quot; Lovemaking Nest . &quot;
Next is Sylvia Slater .
Sylvia &apos;s interested in art training .
She &apos;s a very serious Swiss artist .
And this one had to get broken up .
And they &apos;re interested in creating culture , just tradition .
So they came up with &quot; dig jigs . &quot;
And we got a lot of attention when we did it .
That &apos;s my mom and dad .
This is by Jason Birdsong .
We just have that natural way of seeing .
And he plays with this idea .
So he pairs these up .
There &apos;s another pile of leaves .
Those are actually all real butterfly specimens .
And he pairs these up with paintings .
But it &apos;s actually a painting .
The next artist is Hazel Clausen .
So that &apos;s what she did .
And that &apos;s the symbol of their culture .
This is one of their founders , Gert Schaeffer .
And actually this is my Aunt Irene .
And this is called &quot; Horse Sense Fence . &quot;
Next is Maynard Sipes .
Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller , Jurgi Petrauskas .
Next is Ginger Cheshire .
The next , this is by Sam Sandy .
This is from Estelle Willoughsby .
She heals with color .
Next is by Vera Sokolova .
And I have to say , Vera kind of scares me .
Next , this is by Thomas Swifton .
And after this one , there &apos;s 77 other artists .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thanks .
Thank you . Thanks .
I want to address the issue of compassion .
Compassion has many faces .
They are not luxuries .
Without them , humanity cannot survive . &quot;
Two weeks ago , I was in Bangalore in India .
I looked into her face .
I looked up .
And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for .
They touched me at that time .
And that woman did not have sentimental compassion .
She had phenomenal strength .
So we can ask : What is compassion comprised of ?
And there are various facets .
That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
It is there within every human being .
The very word terror is global .
This is called resilience .
It hooks up all parts of the brain .
Hey , we live in a very noxious world .
Why don &apos;t we train our children in compassion ?
And that is the mental quality of equanimity .
And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara , Kuan-Yin .
Jody Williams called it : It &apos;s good to meditate .
I &apos;m sorry , you &apos;ve got to do a little bit of that , Jody .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m out of here . &quot;
He &apos;s going down the path .
He sees something in the path .
The wound is just filled with maggots .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk all about that .
But this was , I have to admit , all an accident .
I thought the word framework was great .
And they said , oh , you don &apos;t need to do that .
And I said , I &apos;ll go in from the biological side .
Well , it took longer than four years . It &apos;s been about 16 years .
Well , there &apos;s lots of reasons people do science .
One is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things .
We &apos;re curious , and we just go out and get knowledge , you know ?
And people have been working on it for 100 years .
Well , let &apos;s first take a look at what normal science looks like .
This is normal science .
And it goes back and forth , you know ?
You can &apos;t imagine how much detail we know about brains .
A lot of data . But there &apos;s no theory . There &apos;s a little , wimpy box on top there .
And it &apos;s a real shame . Now why has this come about ?
What good is more going to do ?
But , you know what ? It &apos;s very , very regular .
Some people say , brains can &apos;t understand brains .
Very Zen-like . Whoo .
It &apos;s got a lot of cells in it too , right ?
I &apos;ve got this experience , I &apos;m in the world , you know .
There &apos;s something we believe that just , it &apos;s obvious , but it &apos;s wrong .
They all have a lot in common with brain science .
We &apos;re not smarter now than they were then .
It was an intuitive , strong-held belief that was wrong .
And the same thing about tectonic plates , you know ?
What it is is intelligence is defined by prediction .
The word came into you , and you &apos;re making these predictions all the time .
And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses .
It can attack . It can do all kinds of stuff .
But it has all this complex behavior already .
Now , in evolution , what happened ?
You do . It &apos;s your emotional brain .
It &apos;s all those things , and all those gut reactions you have .
And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain .
So let me give you a few examples of predictions .
Now I could change your doorknob in other ways .
You &apos;re constantly making predictions about your environment .
And that &apos;s because you &apos;re making a prediction .
Here &apos;s three visions of an object .
So what is the recipe for brain theory ?
First of all , we have to have the right framework .
Now biologists generally are not good theoreticians .
So what will brain theory look like ?
First of all , it &apos;s going to be a theory about memory .
Not like computer memory . It &apos;s not at all like computer memory .
It &apos;s also memory of sequences .
First of all , it &apos;s going to be built up , we &apos;re going to build the stuff out of silicon .
But they &apos;re very different types of memories .
The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain .
So you &apos;re not going to see C-3PO .
We can also do intelligent security systems .
Those are the things that are going to happen first .
But ultimately , the world &apos;s the limit here .
I don &apos;t know how this is going to turn out .
They couldn &apos;t anticipate cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff .
John Bohannon : Dance vs. powerpoint , a modest proposal
Good afternoon .
Now a laser is different .
I have a Ph.D in molecular biology .
Now surprisingly , it seems to work .
Dance really can make science easier to understand .
But don &apos;t take my word for it .
There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you .
They do it by changing their shape .
One certainly can &apos;t argue with those numbers .
It &apos;s sure to help .
Cynthia Breazeal : The rise of personal robots
But one really struck me .
Scientist : I want to show you something .
I almost lost it this week .
And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo .
Matt Berlin : Hello , Leo .
Leo , this is Cookie Monster .
Can you find Cookie Monster ?
Leo , Cookie Monster is very bad .
He &apos;s very bad , Leo .
Cookie Monster is very , very bad .
He &apos;s a scary monster .
He wants to get your cookies .
It turns out it &apos;s the same for robots .
Mimicry &apos;s believed to play a role , but how ?
We can &apos;t carefully control them because they &apos;re subconscious for us .
But with the robot , you can .
The first was just the screen .
This is just like video conferencing today .
And then the fully expressive MeBot .
We looked at overall engagement .
Now let &apos;s try to put this into a little bit of context .
Let &apos;s think about some other domains , like maybe health .
So we actually explored this idea in our lab .
This is a robot , Autom .
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do .
It could make eye contact with you .
It could share information looking down at a screen .
And then it could help track that for you .
Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters ?
One case was the robot you saw there , Autom .
The quality of advice was identical .
People would name the robots .
They would dress the robots .
They didn &apos;t do this with a computer .
My sons , they love the screen . They love the screen .
But we can push this idea further .
What if -- Nathan : Here it comes . Yay !
CB : -- the character itself could come into your world ?
So here , Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2 .
So they are now sending the character back into that world .
But I want to do more than that .
I actually want them to create those experiences .
I think that &apos;s very , very important .
So this is a new project .
But I can tell you , the thing that they love the most is the robot .
What they care about is the robot .
Thank you .
Charles Limb : Building the musical muscle
We want beauty ; we don &apos;t just want function .
Likewise for hearing .
Really what we want to hear is music .
That process is entirely abstract and very , very unusual .
She &apos;s in a very supportive environment .
Her mother &apos;s doing everything she can .
Okay , play that video please .
Mother : That &apos;s an owl .
Owl , yeah .
Owl . Owl .
Yeah .
Baby . Baby .
You want it ?
Back then you couldn &apos;t even look at the eardrum .
It &apos;s surgically placed inside the inner ear .
This is her 10 years later .
If we could play this video please .
John Niparko : So you &apos;ve written two books ?
Girl : I have written two books .
Girl : No , the other one was a book .
Girl : Yes I do . I remember writing every chapter .
JN : Yeah .
Girl : Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying .
JN : I see . And who is that ?
Girl : Holly .
Mother : Her sister . Girl : My sister .
It comes in handy .
Girl : No .
CL : And so she &apos;s phenomenal .
Now there are a lot of reasons for that .
Language is very different . Language is very precise .
Music is entirely different .
Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing .
Now the problems begin first with pitch perception .
Now if we could just play this .
Go ahead and play this one .
And it might be that you kind of like that .
That &apos;s kind of hypnotic .
If we could play these two sound clips in succession .
The trumpet .
And the second one .
That &apos;s a violin .
Go ahead and play that .
They cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips .
And yes , there is hope .
This is ... does somebody know ?
This is Beethoven .
Because his grave was exhumed .
The brains remain hardwired for music .
Text : Beethoven doesn &apos;t excite her .
The &quot; 1812 Overture &quot; isn &apos;t worth waking for .
And here &apos;s a video of Joseph .
Joseph : I was born in 1986 .
Not long after , I was fitted with hearing aids .
And it was absolutely wonderful .
Since then , I &apos;ve never looked back .
CL : Joseph is phenomenal . He &apos;s brilliant .
You don &apos;t actually have to hear it .
So I just want to conclude with the following words .
You wouldn &apos;t want decent hearing , you would want perfect hearing .
Restoration of basic sensory function is critical .
This is my grandfather .
And this is my son .
These are my buildings .
That &apos;s a wonderful thing .
A hundred million people in the world are homeless .
They &apos;re the materials of the last century .
One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide .
That &apos;s what people jump to as a conclusion .
That &apos;s the change .
Mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks .
Fair enough .
And the way I describe it is this .
The next big issue , deforestation .
The last thing we want to do is cut down trees .
That &apos;s how much it takes .
The carbon story here is a really good one .
And the way I describe it is this .
Buildings are starting to go up around the world .
And I believe the race is ultimately on .
Thank you .
Beardyman : The polyphonic me
What is possible with the human voice ?
Ooh baby baby baby baby baby baby Yeah .
I was constantly experimenting with these noises .
And I &apos;m still on that mission .
And there &apos;s things that no one &apos;s voice can do .
For example , no one can do two notes at the same time .
But that &apos;s cheating .
And it hurts your throat .
And I &apos;m going to show you what it can do .
So the polyphony problem : I &apos;ve only got one voice .
By dancing . It &apos;s like this .
Thanks .
So that &apos;s probably the easiest way .
You don &apos;t have to . It &apos;s fine . Check it out .
I &apos;m going to lay down a bass sound now .
And now , a rockabilly guitar .
And now I have that , I have that recorded .
Assign it to a keyboard .
So that &apos;s cool .
But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd ?
Impossible , you say . No .
using this machine . It &apos;s really fantastic . Check it out .
So every noise you can hear there is my voice .
There &apos;s no samples . There &apos;s no synthesizers .
Why do this ?
Like this .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
Lee Cronin : Making matter come alive
So this is a start .
And I &apos;m absolutely enthralled by biology .
I love to do synthetic biology .
I love things that are alive .
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .
And so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way .
And this seems quite a profound question .
Is biology special ?
Biologists seem to think so .
Is matter evolvable ?
So here &apos;s some inorganic life .
This is an inorganic tube .
Of course , they &apos;re not alive .
And this is dead .
In fact , we were the only people in the universe .
Now , that &apos;s a bit boring .
Is life that improbable ? &quot;
And this is really the question .
And in fact , let &apos;s take that one step further .
In biology , carbon takes center stage .
Well what about matter ?
So think , this is a serious question .
And we also have to be aware of the issues .
And forgive the complicated diagram .
This is just a collection of pathways in the cell .
And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing .
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it .
But what does a cell do ?
Well it divides , it competes , it survives .
And from this stuff we came .
And we went through a variety of worlds .
The RNA people would talk about the RNA world .
We somehow got to proteins and DNA .
We then got to the last ancestor .
Evolution kicked in -- and that &apos;s the cool bit .
And here we are .
But there &apos;s a roadblock that you can &apos;t get past .
This seems most likely .
So we have some kind of primordial soup .
But life begins , what does that mean ?
What is life ? What is this stuff of life ?
And the answer , of course , lies with mice .
I say , &quot; Well I want molecules . &quot;
But I need a metabolism , I need some energy .
Carbon is banned .
But we need to make some containers .
And you can see on the screen a cell being made .
Molecules are competing for stuff .
They want their shape to persist .
And that is the key .
Let &apos;s zoom out to what that could mean .
And that &apos;s really worth thinking about .
We should take our inspiration from biology .
Biology doesn &apos;t care about the design unless it works .
Evolution cannot be cut apart .
You &apos;re sitting on chairs .
They &apos;re inanimate , they &apos;re not alive .
So what does it mean about defining life ?
We really struggle to do this .
Thank you very much .
Just a quick question on timeline .
When ?
And when do you think that will happen ?
LC : Hopefully within the next two years .
That would be a big story .
LC : I think it &apos;s 100 percent .
Lee Cronin , good luck .
Helen Fisher : The brain in love
So , this is the short story of that research .
His name was Jasaw Chan K &apos;awiil .
He stood over six feet tall .
They tell myths and legends about love .
But love isn &apos;t always a happy experience .
Almost nobody gets out of love alive .
I remember what you said to me .
I am thinking of your love for me .
I am torn by your love for me .
I am told you will go from here .
I am told you will leave me here .
My body is numb with grief .
Remember what I said , my love .
Goodbye , my love , goodbye . &quot;
It &apos;s below your emotions .
Romantic love is an obsession . It possesses you .
You lose your sense of self .
You can &apos;t stop thinking about another human being .
Somebody is camping in your head .
Wild is love .
What a bad deal .
And indeed , we now know why .
How , you know , what have I lost ?
It is a need . It is an urge .
It is a homeostatic imbalance .
Like hunger and thirst , it &apos;s almost impossible to stamp out . &quot;
As a matter of fact ethologists know this .
And I just simply say , &quot; Hardly . &quot;
And I said , I don &apos;t know .
These are two women .
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do .
Women get intimacy from face-to-face talking .
This is intimacy to women .
Men tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing .
It &apos;s deeply embedded in the brain .
Pete Alcorn : The world in 2200
I used to be a Malthusian .
Here &apos;s why .
So what then ?
In the cities , a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value .
Take away land speculation , price of land drops .
Number two : a declining population means scarce labor .
Scarce labor drives wages .
So why does this matter ?
Because transitions are dangerous times .
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions .
Thank you .
Nathan Myhrvold : Could this laser zap malaria ?
We invent .
And we do that for a couple of reasons .
We &apos;ve got a different solution .
And we thought , well , that &apos;s not really good enough .
So we made this thing .
Now , this is our second generations prototype .
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine .
It vends out little individual vials .
We &apos;ll move on to malaria .
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this .
Two hundred million people a year .
So what can we do about it ?
It &apos;s a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for .
They don &apos;t always get to everyone .
Now , malaria is an incredibly complicated disease .
We could spend hours going over this .
One of those ways might be better diagnosis .
We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin .
Interesting , anyway , if you &apos;re a solid-state physicist .
There &apos;s a lot of cool stuff we can do with it .
So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond .
That &apos;s really , really , really short .
This is our thousand-core supercomputer .
Okay , we heard about bed nets earlier .
You spend a certain amount per bed net .
Or you could spray .
You can give drug administration .
How can you tell ?
We picked Madagascar .
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data .
So that sets the stage on which you do this .
Ultimately , it gives you this .
This is malaria spreading across Madagascar .
And this is this latter part of the rainy season .
We &apos;re going to the dry season now .
We also try to study our foe .
This is a real ad .
The United States did .
What can we do to the mosquito ?
Well , let &apos;s try to kill it with consumer electronics . &quot;
And , of course , there &apos;s signal processing and digital cameras .
What if we could do that ?
Clinics are full of people that have malaria .
You really want to protect them .
They &apos;re completely natural .
Now , it actually gets better than this .
Now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes .
They &apos;re the only ones that are dangerous .
Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs .
So , this sounds really crazy , right ?
Would you like to see it ?
We have the device over here .
Take it away Eric .
Next we can actually light them up with a laser .
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around .
Here we have it running at high-speed mode .
This is very satisfying .
The energy &apos;s a little bit high here .
Here &apos;s another one . Bang .
The wing motor is very resilient .
Marco Annunziata : Welcome to the age of the industrial internet
And he was right , of course .
It &apos;s the marriage of minds and machines .
And our lives will never be the same .
So what is this industrial Internet ?
Why does any of this matter at all ?
Let &apos;s start with aviation .
Something goes wrong unexpectedly .
So how can the industrial Internet help here ?
Or take healthcare .
And innovation is disruptive .
But let me stress two things here .
It makes products more affordable .
It creates new demand , new jobs .
But now let &apos;s take a step back .
Let &apos;s look at the big picture .
The big discoveries are all behind us . &quot;
They &apos;ve created jobs .
They &apos;ve raised living standards .
That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today .
But this is not a foregone conclusion .
We will need to invest in the new technologies .
We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices .
It &apos;s not going to be easy , but it is going to be worth it .
This new technological revolution is upon us .
Thank you .
The dark blue line is how much the government spends .
The light blue line is how much the government gets in .
Why don &apos;t we lower both lines ?
But that system has tons of problems .
That &apos;s not going to create an equitable , fair society .
They like Social Security . They like Medicare .
Social Security is fairly easy to fix .
Americans are about 50 / 50 , whether they &apos;re Democrats or Republicans .
Raise medical health care contributions ?
They way outweigh Democrats .
That &apos;s a more partisan area .
But that is not the case at all .
Around a quarter say that they are Republicans .
Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
I go by the data . &quot;
And the data is very clear .
Those groups are very , very small .
Or , &quot; Do you think the government should redistribute ? &quot;
Then you can see radical partisan change .
They don &apos;t represent what our views are .
And nothing happened at all .
The fear is that the world is watching .
Thank you .
Alberto Cairo : There are no scraps of men
I &apos;ve been in Afghanistan for 21 years .
We do more than that .
This is the place where we make the legs .
There was so much to learn .
There were so many things new to me .
But it was a terrific job .
There were many other things to do .
It was a strange sensation .
It &apos;s 21 years , but they are still all there .
And the orthopedic center was closed .
But one day , something happened .
I wanted to go home . I was driving .
And everybody disappeared from the street .
The cars disappeared as well .
I ducked .
And only one figure remained in the middle of the road .
So I stopped the car and I went to help .
&quot; I work , &quot; he said .
I wondered , what work ?
Why don &apos;t you have the artificial legs ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; The Red Cross has closed . &quot;
We will provide you with a pair of legs . &quot;
The center is closed , no staff around .
Maybe the machinery is broken .
Who is going to make the legs for him ? &quot;
So I hoped that he would not come .
This is the streets of Kabul in those days .
And so the following day , I went to the orthopedic center .
And I spoke with a gatekeeper .
Nothing can be done .
Give him some money . &quot;
And they were not alone .
And there was some staff too .
I said , &quot; No .
We have to go away . We cannot stay here . &quot;
So , &quot; We cannot stay here , it &apos;s dangerous .
It &apos;s not a priority . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , please . We cannot do that .
It &apos;s really dangerous .
We have other things to do . &quot;
But they insisted .
So we started doing some repairs .
I was doing something that I was not supposed to do .
So we started .
He was telling me , &quot; Patients are coming . &quot;
But people were coming .
And Mahmoud was coming every day .
He was coming every day , crossing the front line .
But finally , the great day arrived .
Mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs .
Very sad , dark .
So we chose a small spot in the garden .
Suddenly , they started fighting .
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting .
Everybody was grabbing something .
And we ran .
And Mahmoud , &quot; Of course I can .
I can run , and now you can go to school .
Later on , we took them home .
Dignity cannot wait for better times .
I met Mahmoud one year later .
I asked about his son .
So I asked him , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
He was sweating .
He was clearly embarrassed .
He said , &quot; You have taught me to walk .
Thank you very much .
That was the job .
&quot; My children are growing .
I feel ashamed .
I said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
I thought , how much money do I have in my pocket ?
Just to give him some money .
It was the easiest way .
And then he sat down .
I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere .
&quot; What ? &quot; I said , &quot; Stop . &quot;
&quot; Well yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
We need to increase the production . &quot;
&quot; Excuse me ? &quot;
I could not believe .
I said , &quot; Listen , it &apos;s insane .
That &apos;s a production line and a very fast one .
But with Najmuddin , we cannot discuss .
I told Najmuddin , &quot; That &apos;s a trick .
I can &apos;t believe it . &quot;
The production was up 20 percent .
&quot; It &apos;s a trick , it &apos;s a trick , &quot; I said .
And then I asked for verification .
It was true .
I understood that I was wrong again .
Mahmoud had looked taller .
He was a new man , taller again .
He has regained his full dignity thanks to that job .
So of course , I understood .
And you know what ?
It &apos;s good for everybody .
But also for the newcomers .
Sometimes you see them , they look , &quot; Oh . &quot;
And you see the faces .
And then the surprise turns into hope .
Scraps of men do not exist .
People like Mahmoud are agents of change .
And when you start changing , you cannot stop .
And when you start , you cannot stop .
That &apos;s Najmuddin , the one with the white coat .
Terrible Najmuddin , is that one .
They are my teachers .
There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan .
It is possible and it is not difficult .
This is my big wish .
We transport the wheelchairs everywhere .
I said , &quot; No , no , no , no , we can &apos;t . &quot;
Is it really necessary ? &quot;
Well now you should see me .
I never miss a single training session .
The night before a match I &apos;m very nervous .
And you should see me during the match .
I shout like a true Italian .
What &apos;s next ? What is going to be the next change ?
That was my story . Thank you very much .
Pavan Sukhdev : Put a value on nature !
And the answer is : Yeah , it can .
But it &apos;s not that straightforward .
So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss .
What is this about ?
And the answer is zilch , exactly zero .
That &apos;s the economic invisibility of nature .
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice ?
They were the ones that didn &apos;t get paid .
That &apos;s the difference .
Because these are important benefits for the poor .
How bad can things get ?
The green represents the percentage .
If you start green , it &apos;s like 80 to 100 percent .
If it &apos;s yellow , it &apos;s 40 to 60 percent .
See that again .
This is the challenge .
That &apos;s not that hard .
So now look at the different lens .
Sorry , this is a global story .
Use of freshwater .
That has to stop .
I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project .
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation .
It was associated largely with the construction industry .
Of course , after the event one can be wise .
He &apos;s basically worked the cost to PUMA .
This can be done .
And I &apos;m delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.
What &apos;s green carbon ?
It &apos;s about energy emissions .
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace .
But that &apos;s all about energy and industry .
More of that in a minute .
So we actually have some movement forward .
But the thing is to do a lot more of that .
Well I &apos;m afraid not .
There is an area that is the oceans , coral reefs .
So that &apos;s almost an eighth of society .
Thank you .
His Holiness the Karmapa : The technology of the heart
I was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment .
His Holiness the Karmapa : Tomorrow is my Talk .
HH : Thank you very much .
Garth Lenz : The true cost of oil
And the Tombstone Valley is home to the Porcupine caribou herd .
Now , you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well .
Again , imagine those all back and forth there .
The other method of extraction is what &apos;s called the in-situ .
So they decided to call it oil sands .
And the tailings ponds range in size up to 9,000 acres .
It &apos;s carcinogenic . &quot;
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
And this is absolutely key .
This is the infrastructure as we see it about now .
Here you see the route down the Mackenzie Valley .
Thank you so much .
Marco Tempest : The magic of truth and lies
Now I feel bad about that .
But people lie every day .
Hold on .
Girl in Phone : Hey , where are you ?
You &apos;ve all done it .
You were great .
MT : Deception , it &apos;s a fundamental part of life .
Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance .
Some people deceive for money .
Let &apos;s play a game .
Three cards , three chances .
Now where &apos;s the lady ?
Where is the queen ?
MT : This one ?
Sorry . You lose .
Well , I didn &apos;t deceive you .
You deceived yourself .
Self-deception .
Sometimes it &apos;s hard to tell the two apart .
They believe they can win .
They forget the times they lose .
The brain is very good at forgetting .
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten .
Bad experiences quickly disappear .
That &apos;s &quot; Clair de Lune . &quot;
Thank you . Thank you very much .
The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s .
And then , of course , to bring us to today .
And Mohammed Ali said , &quot; Me , we . &quot;
A profound statement about the individual and the community .
What can artwork say about this ?
It is why I look to art .
Now , where , perhaps , does this end up right now ?
Thank you .
Isabel Allende : Tales of passion
There &apos;s a Jewish saying that I love .
What is truer than truth ? Answer : The story .
I was told that this was no laughing matter .
My first question was , naturally , what was I going to wear ?
My measurements .
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games .
It is all about passion .
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate .
In the green room I received my uniform .
I looked like a refrigerator .
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great .
I don &apos;t know .
Well , she didn &apos;t say that exactly .
All the cameras were , of course , on Sophia .
A place where most men would love to be .
So here &apos;s a tale of passion .
She &apos;s pregnant and a widow .
Two tiny little boys .
Mapendo , in Swahili , means great love .
I know them well .
They have no education and no freedom .
Feminism is not dead , by no means .
The year is 2005 .
She risks a lot and she &apos;s terrified .
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart .
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation .
At the end , the relieved patient kisses her hands .
The woman &apos;s face looks like a watermelon .
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya .
Women are 51 percent of humankind .
What kind of world do we want ?
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .
What I fear most is power with impunity .
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom .
I &apos;m talking about men with young minds , of course .
I want to make this world good .
Not better , but to make it good .
Thank you .
Conception to birth -- visualized
I got the data .
Early Embryo Yolk sack still feeding Baby .
Here &apos;s a human heart at 25 &#91; weeks &#93; .
It &apos;s just basically two strands .
Then you start to take a look at adult life .
Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries .
Thank you .
My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back .
School &apos;s almost over . Summer is near .
Maybe I &apos;ll get lucky and find easy prey .
Got to get some new gear . There &apos;s no other way .
I &apos;m ready and willing . I &apos;m packing my gun .
This is serious business . This ain &apos;t no fun .
And I can &apos;t have my posse laughin &apos; at me .
The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly .
Not one spot of dirt . The Airs were brand new .
Had my pistol and knew just what to do .
Waited until it was just the right time , followed him very closely behind .
He was coughing , crying , blood spilled on the street .
And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet .
Thank you .
&quot; Yo &apos; wack .
Now I could have quit . I should have quit .
So instead of quitting , I followed him everywhere .
Boards don &apos;t hit back .
Thank you .
Richard St. John : Success is a continuous journey
And it doesn &apos;t take long to go downhill .
I can just sit back and relax . &quot;
I don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t come up with any ideas .
And I got distracted by it .
But I &apos;m a guy ; I knew how to fix it .
I bought a fast car .
It didn &apos;t help .
But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot;
And he put me on anti-depressants .
And clients didn &apos;t call .
And that was great .
But it wasn &apos;t a quick trip .
It took seven years .
It doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
It &apos;s a continuous journey .
So here is to your continued success .
Thank you very much .
Todd Humphreys : How to fool a GPS
Paper maps are becoming obsolete .
Only , I believe , for a lack of imagination .
The Holy Grail , of course , is the GPS dot .
Do you remember the movie &quot; The Da Vinci Code ? &quot;
Now , of course , there is a flip side to the GPS dot .
Well , so did I.
But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol &apos;s case .
&quot; I already have , &quot; she told me .
&quot; I already have , &quot; she replied .
&quot; Okay , what about the FBI ? &quot;
So , there we were .
They get drowned out by the bubble .
And why is that ?
Well , because it &apos;s not a bubble at all .
We &apos;re almost blindly reliant on it .
Some call it &quot; the invisible utility . &quot;
It might be deadly .
The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple .
Instead of jamming the GPS signals , you fake them .
So let me show you how this works .
At this point , the game is over .
The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver .
So is this really possible ?
Well , the short answer is yes .
The key is that civil GPS signals are completely open .
They have no encryption . They have no authentication .
They seemed to speak to me .
They &apos;d say , &quot; Here you are . Here you are . &quot;
And &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
So something felt very wrong about the world .
Imagine , for example , you &apos;re being tracked .
Maybe you &apos;ll have a whole bag full of them .
Thanks .
This is Tamdin .
She is a 69-year-old nun .
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala , India .
This is Paldin .
Paldin is a 62-year-old monk .
And he spent 33 years in prison .
I interview and do portraits .
And this is a little girl .
I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple .
This is Jigme and her sister , Sonam .
This is at 17,000 feet .
And he still is holding this line .
This is another leader of his people .
And Moi is 35 years old .
This is Mengatoue .
I wish they would just go away .
And then we went up and met their shaman .
By the way , Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well .
And this is John Doolikahn , who &apos;s the shaman of the Kalash .
And he &apos;s up in the mountains , right on the border with Afghanistan .
And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn .
We now have 15 sites .
That was one of the big motivating factors .
It was a two million dollar study .
United States came in second to last in geographic knowledge .
We just had a workshop in Guatemala .
Thank you very much .
Gotcha .
Mosquitos . I hate them .
Don &apos;t you ?
But that &apos;s fascinating , right ?
Why does she receive more bites than I do ?
And there &apos;s a whole range of compounds that they do use .
And this was not going to be an easy task .
And therefore , we set up various experiments .
And we found some remarkable differences .
They had a very strong preference for biting on the face .
That &apos;s right .
And this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment .
And you know what ? It worked .
That &apos;s the cheese , just to show you .
My second story is remarkable as well .
It &apos;s about man &apos;s best friend . It &apos;s about dogs .
Why ? Because they are just like the CIA .
In that pool of water , these larvae are concentrated .
They &apos;re all together there . They are immobile .
They can &apos;t escape from that water . They can &apos;t fly .
Ooh , that was very quick .
Man &apos;s best friend in the fight against malaria .
Yeah .
Thank you .
Now let me show you how this works .
Just kidding , just kidding .
Here we go .
Don &apos;t worry , I do this all the time in the lab .
There we go . Okay .
Have a look . That doesn &apos;t work . Okay . Sorry about that .
They don &apos;t kill us . We kill them .
Now — — Maastricht , be prepared .
Hasan Elahi : FBI , here I am !
or &quot; What kind of medium do you work in ? &quot;
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago .
So let me show you a little of that .
So it started over here .
&quot; Where were you the 29th ? the 30th ? &quot;
&quot; Where were you October 5th ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; Great . &quot;
So to the folks from Google , thank you .
Because you have to base it on a yes or no .
I work at a university .
I was like , &quot; No . &quot;
I know everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
So they &apos;re looking at me really odd .
This is with the FBI .
And there was a sincere concern there .
Just wanted to say , &quot; Hey guys .
Just letting you know . Heads up . &quot;
Then I &apos;d make websites .
And then I built this over here . Let me go back to it over here .
So I actually designed this back in 2003 .
I wrote some code for my mobile phone .
But I &apos;ll watch myself . It &apos;s okay .
You don &apos;t have to waste your energy or your resources .
And I &apos;ll help you out .
That &apos;s Kennedy airport , May 19th , Tuesday .
This is in Warsaw .
Singapore . You can see , they &apos;re kind of empty .
And laundry too . Laundry detergent at West Oakland -- East Oakland , sorry .
And there &apos;s a verification taking place .
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee .
Sometimes there &apos;s a lot of information .
And then sometimes you get this .
I spend a lot of time on the road .
So there &apos;s multiple databases .
And there &apos;s thousands and thousands and thousands of images .
So you get something like this .
So sometimes the databases get so specific .
At 11 : 39 a.m. was this one .
Every few moments I shoot the image .
And really , it &apos;s not the most user-friendly interface .
It &apos;s actually quite user-unfriendly .
And you know very little about me actually .
Well you have to take control over it .
But if 300 million people in the U.S.
And we &apos;re getting to that .
Why are you posting these photos ? &quot;
Because no one &apos;s really watching .
No one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot;
Because it &apos;s about surveillance .
I &apos;m watching who &apos;s watching me .
And I came up with these .
So these are some of my sample logs .
And just little bits and pieces , and you can see some of the things there .
Central Intelligence Agency .
Executive Office of the President .
I think they kind of like to look at art .
So thank you very much . I appreciate it .
Hasan , just curious .
HE : Almost none .
It &apos;s no different than sending a text .
It &apos;s no different than checking an email .
So it &apos;s just become another day .
HE : Well it goes to the last point that I was at .
So it holds onto the very last point .
Hasan , thank you very much .
Joseph Nye : Global power shifts
I &apos;m going to talk to you about power in this 21st century .
That &apos;s important and it &apos;s an important shift .
Anybody can play in the game .
The technology was there .
The State still matters .
But the stage is crowded .
We think in terms of war and interstate war .
So let me step back and ask : what &apos;s power ?
Traditionally , the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power .
The tectonic plates of world politics were shifting .
Goldman Sachs has projected that China , the Chinese economy , will surpass that of the U.S.
by 2027 .
First of all , it &apos;s a linear projection .
History is not linear .
There are often bumps along the road , accidents along the way .
You know , it looks at economic power measured by GDP .
It &apos;s all very one-dimensional .
But you might ask , well so what in any case ?
Why does it matter ? Who cares ?
The answer is it matters quite a lot .
Let me give you an example from history .
What caused it ?
Notice both halves of that explanation .
No , I think that &apos;s wrong .
It &apos;s bad history .
Top board : military power among states .
China &apos;s not going to replace the U.S. on this military board .
economic power among states .
Power is multi-polar .
Power is chaotically distributed .
It &apos;s one in which we can all gain .
Wars persist . Power persists .
Military power is important .
Keeping balances is important .
All this still persists .
Hard power is there , and it will remain .
Thank you very much .
David Lang : My underwater robot
So ROVs aren &apos;t new .
They &apos;ve been around for decades .
Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans .
Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction .
What we &apos;ve built isn &apos;t unique .
We kept working on it . We learned a lot .
But then we had to learn how to make them .
We &apos;ve also learned the penguins love robots .
That &apos;s the only way that we could have done this .
So you &apos;re probably all wondering : the cave .
Did you find the gold ?
Thank you .
It &apos;s true . Ninety percent of children do play video games .
But let &apos;s be frank .
So video &#91; gaming &#93; is pervasive throughout our society .
Now I want to step back a bit .
Most parents would find that great .
That &apos;s a statement about vision .
We actually know how to test that statement .
Guess what ? Their vision is really , really good .
It &apos;s better than those that don &apos;t play .
And it &apos;s better in two different ways .
Okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab .
Right ? So this is the first example .
&#91; &quot; Chair &quot; &#93; Orange , good . &#91; &quot; Table &quot; &#93; Green .
&#91; &quot; Board &quot; &#93; Audience : Red.Daphne Bavelier : Red .
&#91; &quot; Horse &quot; &#93; DB : Yellow . Audience : Yellow .
&#91; &quot; Yellow &quot; &#93; DB : Red . Audience : Yellow .
&#91; &quot; Blue &quot; &#93; DB : Yellow .
Was it yellow initially or blue ?
Yellow or blue ?
Audience : Yellow.DB : Good .
That &apos;s for you guys , action video game players .
A bit more challenging , right ?
That &apos;s a multimedia-tasker .
Different video games have a different effect on your brains .
And one more step is to do training studies .
Okay , I &apos;ll help you . Fourth one .
That &apos;s our target shape .
It doesn &apos;t really feel like playing mindless action video games .
They don &apos;t play 10 hours of action games in a row .
Well , we &apos;re working on it , but here is a challenge .
That &apos;s the chocolate side of the equation .
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli ?
Einstein the Parrot : A talking , squawking parrot
Einstein : Einstein .
E : Hello .
SW : That &apos;s nice . Can you be polite ?
E : Hi , sweetheart .
E : Woo .
SW : Yeah .
E : &#91; Squawks &#93; SW : Yeah .
Einstein &apos;s especially interested in Penelope &apos;s talk .
E : Achoo !
Einstein : &#91; Coughs &#93; SW : Yeah .
E : Oh , my God ! My God ! My God !
SW : Yeah . She would get really , really excited .
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive .
E : Ooh .
It would be very dangerous if you fell down .
E : Wheeeeeee ! &#91; Splat &#93; SW : Yeah .
Little splat at the end there . Einstein , did that hurt ?
E : Ow , ow , ow .
SW : Yeah . It &apos;s all a lot of hard work .
Can you get down ?
E : &#91; Bobbing head &#93; SW : Let &apos;s get down for everybody . Come on now .
She &apos;s going to make me do it , too . Ooh , ooh .
Einstein : Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
SW : Do your head now .
E : Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
E : &#91; Operatic squawk &#93; SW : Very good .
Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer ?
Einstein , can you also sing ?
E : La , la .
E : What &apos;s the matter ?
E : Yar .
SW : There you go . And what do pirates like to drink ?
E : Beer .
You like to drink water .
She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man .
What do you say to a good-looking man ?
E : Hey , baby .
E : Yee haw .
Can you sing &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; to him ?
E : Happy birthday to you .
SW : Again .
E : Happy birthday to you .
SW : Again .
E : Happy birthday to you .
SW : Big finish .
E : Happy birthday to you .
SW : Good job !
E : Woo , woo , woo .
SW : What about the other birds ?
E : Tweet , tweet , tweet .
SW : And the penguin ?
E : Quack , quack , quack .
SW : There we go .
E : Ooh , ooh , ooh . Aah , aah , aah .
SW : Very good .
What about a wolf ?
E : Ooooowww .
SW : And a pig ?
E : Oink , oink , oink .
SW : And the rooster ?
E : Cock-a-doodle-doo !
SW : And how about those cats ?
E : Meow .
E : Grrrrr .
SW : What about a skunk ?
E : Stinker .
E : Superstar .
SW : Yeah . You are a superstar .
Now , Einstein does say it best when we ask her .
Why do we want to protect your home ?
E : I &apos;m special .
E : I love you .
E : Goodbye .
SW : Good job . Thank you all .
So it &apos;s enough to bury any industry .
There are several scenarios for the future newspaper .
Sounds nice , but this can only buy time .
So what can we do ?
I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m designing newspapers . &quot;
The front page became our signature .
My approach was very egotistic .
I wanted my artistic statement , my interpretation of reality .
Not even magazines : posters .
Soon it started to bring results .
But it &apos;s not only about the front page .
And music has a rhythm , has ups and downs .
And design is responsible for this experience .
But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design .
Isn &apos;t amazing ?
But the real hit was in Bulgaria .
And that is really amazing .
Did design do this ?
Design was just a part of the process .
And I put strategy at the top of it .
Then we adjust the content accordingly .
And then , usually after two months , we start designing .
My bosses , in the beginning , were very surprised .
So what is the lesson behind it ?
It can even change you .
And who &apos;s responsible ? Designers .
Give power to designers .
But the second is even more important .
And everybody can do it .
You just need inspiration , vision and determination .
Thank you .
The actual events are pretty straightforward .
My friend rushed me to the hospital .
When I entered prison , I was bitter , I was angry , I was hurt .
I didn &apos;t want to take responsibility .
I blamed everybody from my parents to the system .
He said , &quot; Dad , don &apos;t kill .
Jesus watches what you do . Pray to Him . &quot;
At that point is when the transformation began .
But it didn &apos;t come easy .
The second thing was literature .
The third thing was family .
The final thing was writing .
That was pretty much what my life was like .
But the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology .
And I was like , &quot; What is K ? &quot;
And he was like , &quot; K is okay . &quot;
And so I text him a question mark .
And he said , &quot; K = okay . &quot;
And so I tap back , &quot; FU . &quot;
And so fast forward three years , I &apos;m doing relatively good .
I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others .
I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt .
The second thing was apologizing .
I had to apologize to the people I had hurt .
But I also had to apologize to myself .
The third thing was atoning .
Thank you .
I was born and raised in North Korea .
But then the great famine began in 1994 .
I was four years old .
Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
I saw my father wither away and die .
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
I was not uncommon .
That hope kept me alive .
I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
Hope kept me alive .
I was 16 years old .
I thought more people would help me .
And I barely finished elementary school .
Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
At one point , my father gave up on me .
He said , &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot;
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
That chicken wing changed my life .
You have to choose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
In North Korea , I made it myself .
Hope brought me to America .
I did not come here by myself .
I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
Thank you .
Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
And I -- oh , gosh .
I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
AH : Sure , please .
Thank you .
Sleepy Man Banjo Boys : Teen wonders play bluegrass
TM : Thank you , thank you .
Robbie Mizzone : Thank you .
TM : Thank you .
JM : Thank you all .
TM : Thank you very much .
David Perry : Are games better than life ?
I couldn &apos;t pick a career .
My mother wanted me to be a dentist .
And this was a pretty common sight .
The school I went to was pretty boring .
They forced us to learn things like Latin .
And that was the finishing post right there .
So this was extremely embarrassing .
The graphics were just horrible .
They started making their own video games .
And that &apos;s what it looked like .
That was much better .
It grows every year .
Last year was the biggest year .
By 2008 , we &apos;re going to kick the butt of the music industry .
By 2010 , we &apos;re going to hit 42 billion .
43 percent of gamers are female .
The average age of gamers ?
Well , obviously it &apos;s for children , right ?
So 37 is our target audience .
All video games are violent .
Of course the newspapers love to beat on this .
Online gaming statistics .
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions .
But he got great terms on it .
That &apos;s what the show looks like .
It &apos;s very , very epic and a very beautiful concert .
And the people that went there absolutely loved it .
So we &apos;re going to start that video .
Throughout human history people have played games .
You need to be really an incredible artist .
And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about .
So I &apos;d like to play this video .
At some point something clicked .
I am just one of a new generation that is growing up .
I know I can .
We are interacting with our entertainment .
I have come to expect this level of interaction .
The people who create these games are smart .
These are all troubles outside of myself .
The sensory cues are very similar .
For my virtual worlds are perfect .
More beautiful and rich than the real world around us .
But maybe brainwashing isn &apos;t always bad .
There is a potential to do good as well .
I know that I am losing my grip .
Part of me is just waiting to let go .
DP : Wow .
The most important one being fun .
The name of this track is &quot; The Magic To Come . &quot;
Who is that going to come from ?
I don &apos;t think so .
You &apos;re off , you &apos;re off . That &apos;s it .
He &apos;s out of time .
Go ahead . I &apos;m going to stay right here though .
This is my daughter , her name &apos;s Emma , she &apos;s 17 months old .
And as I &apos;ve shown here , we have the audience .
You know , we have the technology .
I just hope she likes video games .
So , my closing thought .
Thank you .
David Perry . That was awesome .
Hans Rosling : The magic washing machine
That was a great day for my mother .
And Grandma was even more excited .
Let me , let me push the button . &quot;
I want to see this ! Give me a chair !
She was mesmerized .
To my grandmother , the washing machine was a miracle .
Look , the homes are full of machines .
I can &apos;t even name them all .
And they consume more than $ 40 per day .
So two billion have access to washing machines .
They wash like this : by hand .
And they want the washing machine .
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way .
And no one raised their hand .
Here we are .
And they also have electricity .
That makes 12 of them .
First , population growth .
Second , economic growth .
What will happen is economic growth .
&quot; Wopp ! &quot; they will say .
And these people , they want the washing machine .
I told you . They &apos;ll go there .
And they will double their energy use .
So what needs to be done ?
It &apos;s real .
Of course they must be more energy-efficient .
They must change behavior in some way .
This is what we hope may happen .
It &apos;s a real challenge in the future .
They love them .
And what &apos;s the magic with them ?
The machine will make the work .
And now we can go to the library . &quot;
And mother got time to read for me .
And she also got books for herself .
And we really , we really loved this machine .
Thank you steel mill .
Thank you power station .
Thank you very much .
It lists every known mental disorder .
And it lists currently 374 mental disorders .
I &apos;m kidding . I &apos;m not kidding .
I &apos;m kidding .
And I &apos;ve got malingering .
They &apos;re called the CCHR .
And I said , &quot; How ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; We &apos;re going to introduce you to Tony . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Who &apos;s Tony ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Tony &apos;s in Broadmoor . &quot;
Now Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital .
And I said to Brian , &quot; What did Tony do ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Hardly anything .
Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony ? &quot;
So I said , &quot; Yes , please . &quot;
So I got the train to Broadmoor .
And we got to Broadmoor .
It looks like a giant Hampton Inn .
And the patients started drifting in .
And then Brian said , &quot; Here &apos;s Tony . &quot;
And a man was walking in .
And he wasn &apos;t overweight , he was in very good physical shape .
And he sat down .
Fake madness .
Nurses will bring you pizzas .
Anyway he faked madness too well , he said .
They sent him to Broadmoor .
I &apos;m not mentally ill . &quot;
I said , &quot; How long have you been here for ? &quot;
I &apos;ve been in Broadmoor for 12 years . &quot;
But how do you sit in a sane way ?
How do you cross your legs in a sane way ?
It &apos;s just impossible . &quot;
Am I crossing my legs like a journalist ? &quot;
So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening .
And they take that as a sign of madness .
I said , &quot; What &apos;s the story ? &quot;
However , we have assessed him .
It &apos;s on the checklist : cunning and manipulative .
He was a psychopath .
So I did .
So there &apos;s 1,500 people in his room .
Fifteen of you are psychopaths .
Who cares ? That &apos;s not a big story .
The big story , &quot; he said , &quot; is corporate psychopathy .
And they didn &apos;t reply .
So I changed tack .
And he said , &quot; Come on over . &quot;
There were lions and tigers .
He was taking me through the garden .
There were falcons and eagles .
He was saying to me , &quot; Over there you &apos;ve got sharks . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve got more sharks and you &apos;ve got tigers . &quot;
It was like Narnia .
And then we went into his kitchen .
He &apos;d close down 30 percent of the workforce .
And he &apos;d quite often fire people with a joke .
He said , &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s an amazing theory .
And I said , &quot; A psychopath . &quot;
Can I go through them with you ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Manipulative . &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s leadership . &quot;
He said no to many short-term marital relationships .
He &apos;s only ever been married twice .
It &apos;s what all journalists do .
And we leave the normal stuff on the floor .
When I got back to London , Tony phoned me .
I said , &quot; Well they say that you &apos;re a psychopath . &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m not a psychopath . &quot;
He said , &quot; I &apos;ve got a tribunal coming up .
Will you come to it ? &quot;
So I said okay .
So I went to his tribunal .
So they let him go .
Everyone &apos;s a bit psychopathic . &quot;
I said , &quot; What are you going to do now ? &quot;
And for the last 20 months everything was fine .
Nothing bad happened .
And then he phoned me .
And what Tony is , is he &apos;s a semi-psychopath .
Thank you .
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system .
And I believe the answer is yes .
And that is exactly what we found .
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown .
He &apos;s dedicated his life to sustainable design .
There &apos;s a new microbe , I just discovered it .
Thank you .
Philippe Starck : Design and destiny
I mean , I feel useless .
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t try to design the toothbrush .
That doesn &apos;t interest me .
Because there is different types of design .
I call that the cynical design .
What civilization creates this society ?
What animal species creates this civilization ?
Me , I have strictly no power to change anything .
There is things to see , there is the big challenge .
The big challenge in front of us .
Voice offstage : Four point five .
At the end , finally , that succeeds , and life appears .
We was so , so stupid . The most stupid bacteria .
Fantastic ! It &apos;s a beauty !
And this territory is fantastic .
Because every generation thinks we are the final one .
Something like that . I am not sure of that .
We can say that .
I can explain you . I shall try .
And you will fall , and you will die . Dangerous .
You , you survive . It &apos;s OK .
I live in society ; I live in community .
The more you will rise , the more you will be important for the civilization .
From this to here , that , it &apos;s genius .
Ptolemy , Eratosthenes , Einstein , things like that .
Nobody &apos;s obliged to be a genius .
It &apos;s better , but nobody .
It &apos;s called schizophrenia , and you are dead also .
Never forget -- like that , like that .
It &apos;s very , very , very important .
This line of evolution is clearly positive .
From far , this line looks very smooth , like that .
It &apos;s made of light and shadow .
We can say light is civilization , shadow is barbaria .
And it &apos;s very important to know where we are .
In this case , people like me are acceptable .
We can say , &quot; It &apos;s luxurious time . &quot;
It &apos;s OK . We are in the light .
With many , many , many , many face of barbaria .
There is different type of barbaria .
That &apos;s why we must adapt .
Forget all that . There is priority ; there is urgency .
You must go back to fight , to battle .
Because it &apos;s not the right time .
We have just to finish the story .
That is very , very important .
And you can fall , and it &apos;s very dangerous .
No , you must really understand that .
We give you white pages . Invent .
Cesar Kuriyama : One second every day
So , I &apos;m an artist .
They &apos;re not even enjoying the show .
Thank you .
Sean Carroll : Distant time and the hint of a multiverse
The universe is really big .
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
It &apos;s extremely beautiful .
But we would also like to understand it .
So we say the universe is expanding .
In the past , the universe was more dense , and it was also hotter .
That kind of makes sense to us .
The air in this room is very smooth .
In particular , things were a lot denser .
We would like to know what .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cosmologists .
So that &apos;s our job .
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve figured it out by now .
We learned that it &apos;s accelerating .
The universe is not only expanding .
It &apos;s just the idea that empty space itself has energy .
And this energy , according to Einstein , exerts a push on the universe .
For one thing , the universe will expand forever .
Einstein was fond of this idea .
Finally , empty space has a temperature .
The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations .
Well what is the implication of that ?
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century .
But that &apos;s a probabilistic statement .
It will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge .
It &apos;s very , very unlikely .
Remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time .
But there will also be large fluctuations .
That &apos;s the region where entropy is low .
But he was not right .
So this scenario makes predictions .
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation .
And Feynman also understood this .
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation . &quot;
I just showed you this picture .
It &apos;s cooling off .
They will fall into black holes .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black holes don &apos;t last forever .
That empty space lasts essentially forever .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
Why aren &apos;t we in empty space ?
Why aren &apos;t you ?
More homework assignment for you .
I &apos;m going to give you my favorite scenario .
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken .
That &apos;s my favorite scenario .
This is a prediction . I might be wrong .
Thank you .
Al Seckel : Visual illusions that show how we think
And figure goes to ground .
And for the musicians .
And of course , since happiness -- we want &quot; joy to the world . &quot;
Pianist transforms to violinist .
William Kamkwamba : How I built a windmill
William , hi . Good to see you .
William Kamkwamba : Thanks .
Where ? What country ?
WK : In Malawi , Kasungu . In Kasungu . Yeah , Mala .
OK . Now , you &apos;re 19 now ?
WK : Yeah . I &apos;m 19 years now .
WK : I wanted to make a windmill .
A windmill ?
WK : Yeah .
WK : Yeah .
And I tried , and I made it .
WK : Ah , no . I just -- What happened ?
The book had three , yours had four .
WK : Yeah .
And you made it out of what ?
OK .
WK : Yeah .
WK : Yeah . I test .
And what did you make the windmill out of ?
What materials did you use ?
WK : Yeah . The windmill .
And so , and that windmill , what -- it worked ?
How much electricity ?
WK : 12 watts .
WK : Four bulbs and two radios .
Wow .
WK : Yeah .
Next slide -- so who &apos;s that ?
WK : Yeah .
And so what &apos;s your -- what are you going to do with this ?
So this one would have to be bigger ?
WK : Yeah .
How big ?
WK : Yeah .
Thank you so much for coming .
WK : Thank you .
Jack Choi : On the virtual dissection table
So we call this Anatomage Table .
I &apos;m going to do some demonstrations .
I &apos;m going to do some cuts .
Then it &apos;s going to show inside .
You can see some internal organs .
So we call this the slicer mode .
OK , I &apos;m going to do another cut .
Right there .
This shows a lot of internal structures .
Like this .
Right here .
the liver right here .
OK .
Let &apos;s say I &apos;m interested in looking at the heart .
I &apos;m going to do some surgery here .
I &apos;m going to cut some veins , arteries .
Oops ! ...
But fortunately , our digital man has &quot; undo . &quot;
Okay .
All right then .
Let me zoom in .
I &apos;m going to make a cut right there .
And then you can see the inside of the heart .
It doesn &apos;t have to be always dissection .
Since it &apos;s digital , we can do reverse dissection .
Yep .
Maybe I can add quickly this way .
We can see tendons and muscles .
And this is another way to learn anatomy .
It &apos;s a female now .
So this is Anatomage Table . Thank you .
Helen Fisher : Why we love , why we cheat
&quot; What &apos; tis to love ? &quot; Shakespeare said .
George Bernard Shaw said it a little differently .
And indeed , that &apos;s what we do .
And then you just focus on this person .
As Chaucer said , &quot; Love is blind . &quot;
Real dependence on this person .
Simple . Romantic love is very simple .
You become extremely sexually possessive .
The other main characteristic is motivation .
But my most important question was always the same .
And my final question was always the same .
And , indeed , these people would say &quot; Yes ! &quot;
I was just staggered by it .
And indeed , that &apos;s exactly what happens .
The motor of the brain . It &apos;s a drive .
They have songs , poems , novels , sculptures , paintings , myths , legends .
One is the sex drive : the craving for sexual gratification .
It can be focused on nobody .
It &apos;s very slow .
And , indeed , that caravan is moving on .
Women are moving back into the job market .
The double income family was the standard .
In short , we &apos;re really moving forward to the past .
And it &apos;s going to have an impact .
Women can talk .
And , indeed , they &apos;re becoming a very powerful force .
And I think that the television is like the global campfire .
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women .
They &apos;ve got incredible people skills , negotiating skills .
They &apos;re highly imaginative .
They &apos;re both perfectly good ways of thinking .
We need both of them to get ahead .
In fact , there &apos;s many more male geniuses in the world .
When the -- and there &apos;s also many more male idiots in the world .
Foremost , women are starting to express their sexuality .
&quot; Oh , well -- men are more adulterous ! &quot;
And -- basic math !
Anyway .
We &apos;re also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality .
We &apos;re also seeing a rise of romantic love .
It may decline some more .
However , there &apos;s always kinds of complications in this .
They can go together , by the way .
That &apos;s why casual sex isn &apos;t so casual .
I think the happiness we find , we make .
So I want to conclude with two things .
The worry is about antidepressants .
And these drugs are going generic .
They are seeping around the world .
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else .
I would recommend it .
Everybody knows that .
Dopamine is associated with romantic love .
The things are connected in the brain .
So now -- -- thank you .
They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Timing is important . Proximity is important .
I &apos;ve been carrying on here about the biology of love .
And they were all at a conference in Beijing .
There &apos;s magic to love !
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .
Thank you .
And the ice that is there is quite thin .
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there .
And it received quite a bit of attention .
These are the lions and tigers of the sea .
It &apos;s a very solitary creature .
But it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range .
This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph .
They also get entangled in fishing gear .
These are entanglement scars .
They hold on to them , and it eventually kills them .
I went down there in the winter time .
And that &apos;s because the urchins eat kelp .
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .
So I think the message is clear .
Thank you very much .
Nathalie Miebach : Art made of storms
I find weather extremely fascinating .
All of my work begins very simple .
That &apos;s both historical as well as real data .
These clipboards are filled with numbers .
That begins my translation process .
Every colored bead , every colored string , represents a weather element .
I also translate weather data into musical scores .
So all of these scores are made up of weather data .
And together , these variables construct a score .
So for me , that was my way into it .
Thank you .
David Hoffman : What happens when you lose everything
I had a fire nine days ago .
It &apos;s gone .
I always live in the present -- I love the present .
I cherish the future .
That &apos;s my papers .
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes .
By the way , that &apos;s &quot; Sputnik . &quot; I ran it last year .
That &apos;s me at my desk .
You know -- all the stuff .
That &apos;s my daughter , Jean .
&quot; Dig it up , &quot; I said . &quot; Pieces .
I want pieces . Bits and pieces . &quot;
Idea about women .
So I started to say , &quot; Hey , man , you are too much !
I mean , this was 16-millimeter safety film .
The negatives are gone .
That &apos;s my daughter and me .
That &apos;s my house .
My family &apos;s living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley .
My children , Davey and Henry .
My son , Davey , in the hotel two nights ago .
I came to live it , and I am living it .
Thank you everybody .
Geraldine Hamilton : Body parts on a chip
We seem to be spending more and more money .
More money , less drugs . Hmm .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
Now let &apos;s talk about the first one , cells in dishes .
So , cells are happily functioning in our bodies .
Guess what . They don &apos;t .
What about animal testing ?
Well , animals do and can provide extremely useful information .
We learn more about the biology itself .
So we need better tools .
Our bodies are dynamic environments .
We &apos;re in constant motion .
Our cells experience that .
They &apos;re in dynamic environments in our body .
They &apos;re under constant mechanical forces .
And at the Wyss Institute , we &apos;ve done just that .
And I have one right here .
It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ? But it &apos;s pretty incredible .
And it &apos;s not just beautiful .
It can do a tremendous amount of things .
There &apos;s been many people trying to grow cells in the lab .
They &apos;ve tried many different approaches .
They &apos;ve even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab .
We &apos;re not trying to do that here .
We have three fluidic channels .
Let me show you .
then we can add human white blood cells .
It &apos;s pretty exciting .
Yeah . Mucus . Yuck .
But mucus is actually very important .
And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis .
We have a gut on a chip .
You can see one right here .
This is a disease that affects a large number of individuals .
Now we &apos;re really getting excited .
Does it change the beating of your heart ?
Does it have a toxicity ?
Does it get cleared by the liver ?
Is it metabolized in the liver ?
Is it excreted in your kidneys ?
Tends to be middle aged , tends to be female .
Children are not adults .
They may not respond in the same way adults do .
It &apos;s pretty exciting .
And this is key to the potential of that technology .
Now let me show you our instrument .
It does something else that &apos;s very important .
It creates an easy user interface .
Plug and play . Easy .
So how do we prevent them ?
Personalized medicine . Thank you .
Dale Dougherty : We are makers
I really believe that .
All of us are makers .
We &apos;re born makers .
We don &apos;t just live , but we make .
We create things .
It &apos;s a scraper bike ; it &apos;s called -- from Oakland .
Apparently it can .
I might get one of those .
Where did you guys get those ?
Muffin : Will you glide with us ?
We got there first .
Lady : Will you glide with us ?
That &apos;s the experience of a clever ride .
And of course , we have fashion .
People are remaking things into fashion .
Now this one takes a little bit of explaining .
You know what those are , right ?
And here he &apos;ll explain a little bit about what it does .
So , are you a maker ?
And again , think about it .
Makers are in control .
They want to use it to their own purpose .
They &apos;re not mainstream .
They &apos;re a little bit radical .
They &apos;re a bit subversive in what they do .
And I found this old video .
It didn &apos;t just exist .
And I think that &apos;s tremendously important .
This is Andrew Archer .
Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth , Minnesota .
He liked to take things apart .
And he began building robots .
And that &apos;s why he moved to Michigan .
And this kind of gets to this important idea today .
And so it &apos;s a very interesting phenomenon that &apos;s going across the world .
But essentially these are people that are playing with technology .
Let me say that again : playing .
It &apos;s a micro-controller .
Now here &apos;s something -- a 3D printer .
That &apos;s another tool that &apos;s really taken off -- really , really interesting .
This is Makerbot .
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
And they do interesting things .
Fascinating work they &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace .
Well he did a little bit better than free .
It &apos;s more makers .
Thank you very much .
Michael Pawlyn : Using nature &apos;s genius in architecture
I &apos;d like to start with a couple of quick examples .
The nearest we &apos;ve come is with aramid fiber .
It does suggest we &apos;ve still got a bit to learn .
Firstly , radical increases in resource efficiency .
It &apos;s a high-strength polymer .
So that was a factor-100 saving .
Nature works very differently .
It was ending up in landfills .
Some of you may recognize this .
The converse is also true .
So our energy problems are not intractable .
It &apos;s a challenge to our ingenuity .
CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater .
CSP produces a lot of waste heat .
So this is how this scheme would look .
The next thing is sodium chloride .
This is a hotel in Bolivia .
And it &apos;s pushing the ecosystem close to collapse .
They &apos;re not just possible ; they &apos;re critical .
And this is an important point .
Thank you .
Neil Pasricha : The 3 A &apos;s of awesome
My mom left Nairobi , Kenya .
And they got here in the late 1960s .
We had close family , good friends , a quiet street .
We grew up , and we grew older .
I went to high school .
I graduated .
Life was pretty good .
2006 was a great year .
2007 was a great year .
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher .
First of all , the news was so heavy .
I spoke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p.m.
on a Sunday night .
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening .
And Monday morning , I found out that he disappeared .
Very sadly , he took his own life .
And it was a really heavy time .
And nobody read it except for my mom .
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger .
I was like , that sounds totally fake .
So let &apos;s talk about those three As .
They are Attitude , Awareness and Authenticity .
I &apos;d love to just talk about each one briefly .
The second &quot; A &quot; is Awareness .
I love hanging out with three year-olds .
Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year-old .
They &apos;re in there .
The last &quot; A &quot; is Authenticity .
And for this one , I want to tell you a quick story .
He &apos;s number 76 in the picture .
But Rosey Grier also had another passion .
In his deeply authentic self , he also loved needlepoint .
He loved knitting .
That &apos;s what he said .
It &apos;s a great cover .
You meet people that you like talking to .
You go places you &apos;ve dreamt about .
So those are the three A &apos;s .
So I wanted to ask them to , if they don &apos;t mind , stand up .
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys .
I didn &apos;t know what was meat , what was vegetarian .
I was eating olives with pie .
I just couldn &apos;t believe how many things you can get here . &quot;
They &apos;ve got an apple here from South Africa .
Can you believe they &apos;ve got a date from Morocco ? &quot;
He &apos;s like , &quot; Do you know where Morocco even is ? &quot;
Is this A &amp; amp ; P ? &quot;
And he &apos;d say , &quot; I don &apos;t know where Morocco is either , but let &apos;s find out . &quot;
And so we &apos;d buy the date , and we &apos;d go home .
And I &apos;d say , &quot; I don &apos;t believe that . &quot;
And he &apos;s like , &quot; I don &apos;t believe it either .
There are so many things to be happy about .
We &apos;re the only ones with jewelry and democracy .
We &apos;ve got fashion magazines , house party scenes .
You can watch a horror movie with monsters .
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming .
You can sleep in clean sheets .
You can go to the movies and get good seats .
And that &apos;s the sad part .
You will never be as young as you are right now .
Thank you .
Natalie MacMaster : Cape Breton fiddling in reel time
The idea is actually pretty simple .
Have you ever wanted to write a novel ?
So I did .
No . I wrote it in a month .
It &apos;s awful .
So here &apos;s one last thing I &apos;d like to mention .
In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
But they &apos;re less likely to stick .
Thanks .
Emily Pilloton : Teaching design for change
So this is Bertie County , North Carolina , USA .
And it &apos;s very flat . It &apos;s very swampy .
It &apos;s mostly farmland .
We know the symptoms .
It &apos;s downtowns becoming ghost towns .
It is the poorest county in the state .
The economy is mostly agricultural .
The county seat is Windsor .
There isn &apos;t even a Walmart .
So fast-forward to today , and we now live there .
We now call this place home .
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger .
There isn &apos;t a single licensed architect in the whole county .
So the first of the three is design for education .
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways .
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs .
So this is Mr. Perry . He &apos;s the assistant superintendent .
So the second approach is redesigning education itself .
This is the most complex .
It &apos;s a vocational training path .
It &apos;s working-class ; it &apos;s blue-collar .
And this is what it looks like .
This is Ryan .
She is 15 years old .
This is Eric . He plays for the football team .
And then this is Anthony .
Thank you .
David Christian : The history of our world in 18 minutes
First , a video .
Yes , it is a scrambled egg .
And now they &apos;re going to be poured back into the egg .
And yet , look around us .
What we see around us is staggering complexity .
And slightly more complex things appear .
We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments .
And at each threshold , the going gets tougher .
So let &apos;s do it .
Around us , there &apos;s nothing .
There &apos;s not even time or space .
And we &apos;ve crossed our first threshold .
It &apos;s incredibly hot .
And it &apos;s expanding at incredible speed .
Now we move forward 380,000 years .
But that &apos;s not completely true .
And this is how it works .
Gravity is more powerful where there &apos;s more stuff .
We have our first stars .
And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex .
So now the universe is chemically more complex .
Now , the going gets tougher .
I &apos;m talking , of course , about living organisms .
Living organisms are created by chemistry .
We are huge packages of chemicals .
So , chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force .
Now , what are the ideal conditions for chemistry ?
What are the Goldilocks conditions ?
But not too little .
Why ?
Now , where do you find such Goldilocks conditions ?
Each rung contains information .
So , DNA contains information about how to make living organisms .
And DNA also copies itself .
So , it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean .
So the information spreads .
And what that means is that DNA is , in effect , learning .
And occasionally , there are disasters .
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago .
Let me explain why .
But it is so slow .
They accumulate information , they learn .
I call this ability collective learning .
It &apos;s what makes us different .
Farming was an energy bonanza .
And that brain is learning at warp speed .
So , here we are , back at the convention center .
But it also contains warnings .
And now , finally , this is what I want .
I thank you for your attention .
Stefan Sagmeister : Designing with slogans
They were combined in the media .
We &apos;re doing changing media .
You can &apos;t help but actually ripping that spider web apart .
All of these things are pieces of graphic design .
We do them for our clients .
They are commissioned .
&quot; Worrying solves nothing . &quot;
The printer lost the file , didn &apos;t tell us .
It said , &quot; Money does does make me happy . &quot;
Everybody participated -- Milton Glaser , Massimo Vignelli .
Singapore was quite in discussion .
And the very last one is a billboard .
We let that lie around in the sun .
Thank you so much .
This is how war starts .
Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation .
It stops .
She was a young mother . She was someone who liked to party .
Great person .
She thinks she &apos;s dreaming , but she &apos;s not .
I learned about compassion .
I learned about sharing . I learned about camaraderie .
Most of all , I learned about love .
I learned so much about myself .
They don &apos;t get their money out .
And then war and chaos descend .
Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot .
And that was just a small percentage of the dead .
And that &apos;s pretty much why I do it .
Why aren &apos;t you home with Luca ? &quot;
I have to report it . &quot;
But there will always be another war . &quot;
And there , sadly , will always be wars .
He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn &apos;t do it .
All I am is a witness .
And that &apos;s what I try to do .
Who cares about Syria ? Who cares about Bosnia ?
Thank you very much .
Arthur Benjamin : A performance of &quot; Mathemagic &quot;
Well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
I -- was -- your hand go up ?
I see , I see one way in the back .
How about a two-digit number ?
Audience : 22 .
Arthur Benjamin : 22 . And another two-digit number , Sir ?
Audience : 47 .
No .
OK , great .
For instance , five squared would be ?
Audience : 25 .
So quickly , a two-digit number please .
Audience : 37 .
37 squared , OK .
Audience : 23 .
23 squared , OK .
Audience : 59 .
59 squared , OK , and finally ?

Thank you very much .
Let me try to take this one step further .
I &apos;m going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time .
Anyone on our panel , verify the answer .
Just give some indication if it &apos;s right .
A three-digit number , sir , yes ?
Audience : 987 .
987 squared is 974,169 .
Yes ? Good .
Audience : 457 .
457 squared is 205,849 .
205,849 ?
Yes ?
OK , another , another three-digit number , sir ?
Audience : 321 .
321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
Yes ? One more three-digit number please .
Audience : Oh , 722 .
722 is 500 -- ooh , that &apos;s a harder one .
Is that 513,284 ?
Yes .
Yes ? Oh , one more , one more three-digit number please .
Audience : 162 .
162 squared is 26,244 .
Thank you very much .
Let me try to take this one step further .

95,218,564 ?
Yes .
Thank you very much .
Eight-digit capacity -- don &apos;t you hate that ?
Does yours go higher ?
Oh -- yours does ?
I can probably do it .
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
Seven , and yours ? Seven .
Seven ? Seven ?
And , uncertain .
Yeah .
One , OK , 197042 .
Did you leave out the number 6 ?
44875 .
079044 .
I think you left out the number 3 ?
OK , any six of them .
Really scramble them up this time , please .
263972 .
Did you leave out the number 7 ?
Thank you very much .
What year ?
Audience : 1953 .
1953 , and the month ?
Audience : November . November what ?
Audience : 23rd .
23rd -- was that a Monday ? Audience : Yes .
OK , it &apos;s -- how about you , what year ?
Audience : 1949 . 1949 , and the month ?
Audience : October . October what ?
Audience : Fifth .
Fifth -- was that a Wednesday ?
Yell it out , what year ? Audience : 1959 .
1959 , OK -- and the month ?
Audience : February .
February what ? Audience : Sixth .
Sixth -- was that a Friday ? Audience : Yes .
Good , how about the person behind her ?
Audience : 1947 . 1947 , and the month ?
Audience : May . May what ?
Audience : Seventh . Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday ?
Audience : Yes .
Thank you very much .
We can do it that way .
I brought with me a book of calendars .
What year was it , first of all ?
Audience : 1966 .
&apos;66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966 -- and what month ?
Audience : April . April what ?
Audience : 17th . 17th -- I believe that was a Sunday .
Can you confirm , Chris ?
What year , Chris , would you like ?
1824 .
1824 , OK .
And what month ? June .
June what ? Sixth .
Sixth -- was that a Sunday ?
It was . And it was cloudy .
Good , thank you very much .
Audience : Five . Five .
Audience : Seven . Seven .
Audience : Six . Six .
Audience : Eight . Eight .
Audience : Three . Three .
57,683 squared . Yuck .
Let me explain to you how I &apos;m going to attempt this problem .
I &apos;m going to break the problem down into three parts .
Now , let me recap .
Thank you .
Let me explain what that is .
So , without any more stalling , here we go .
I &apos;ll start the problem in the middle , with 57 times 683 .
38,931 ; double that to get 77,862 .
77,862 becomes cookie fission , cookie fission is 77,822 .
That seems right , I &apos;ll go on . Cookie fission , OK .
Audience : Yeah !
Good .
Thank you very much .
I hope you enjoyed mathemagics . Thank you .
Erik Brynjolfsson : The key to growth ? Race with the machines
Growth is not dead .
That &apos;s long enough for a generation of managers to retire .
Sure . It &apos;s the computer .
But technology alone is not enough .
Technology is not destiny .
Let &apos;s look at some data .
So here &apos;s GDP per person in America .
And here &apos;s productivity .
After a lag , productivity accelerated again .
And that &apos;s just the United States .
The global news is even better .
Now getting stuff for free is a good thing , right ?
Sure , of course it is .
But that &apos;s not how economists measure GDP .
Now let &apos;s look to the future .
Welcome to the economics of abundance .
Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress .
Secondly , the new machine age is exponential .
Computers get better faster than anything else ever .
But our brains are wired for a linear world .
As a result , exponential trends take us by surprise .
Thirdly , the new machine age is combinatorial .
Consider one project : IBM &apos;s Watson .
At age seven , Watson is still kind of in its childhood .
Damn .
But you know , Watson is growing up fast .
No . Technology is not destiny .
She can &apos;t .
But 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs .
That is our grand challenge .
Racing with the machine beats racing against the machine .
Technology is not destiny .
We shape our destiny .
Thank you .
Jonas Eliasson : How to solve traffic jams
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon .
But then , on the other hand , you have the American cities .
It &apos;s moving by itself , okay .
But all of these attempts have one thing in common .
&quot; Oh , but surely someone must be in charge .
&quot; No . No . No one is in charge .
It basically organizes itself . &quot;
It organizes itself .
This is a map of Stockholm , my hometown .
You would be wrong .
Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic .
You really reduce congestion quite substantially .
But it was fun anyway .
So , we followed up . What happened ?
The first day they all came back .
Seventy percent of the population didn &apos;t want this .
Okay . So why can that be ? Why is that ?
And it turned out that they don &apos;t know themselves .
They &apos;re not even aware of this themselves .
Who changed their opinion , and why ?
You should just nudge them in the right direction .
Thank you .
Sheena Iyengar : The art of choosing
&quot; I know , &quot; I said . &quot; I &apos;m aware of this custom .
But I really like my tea sweet . &quot;
&quot; One does not put sugar in green tea . &quot;
Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar .
It is essential for success .
It &apos;s called &quot; being true to yourself . &quot;
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands .
You will surely find the perfect match .
&quot; Oh , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
It &apos;s all just soda . That &apos;s just one choice . &quot;
Grzegorz from Warsaw said , &quot; Ah , for me it is fear .
There are some dilemmas you see .
I am used to no choice . &quot;
We do not need everything that is there . &quot;
To examine this , let &apos;s go back to the U.S.
and then hop across the pond to France .
What do they do ?
What do any parent do ?
They had all suffered the same tragedy .
But there was a big difference .
We found that it did .
How did they get me to do that ? &quot;
In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed .
We interpret what we see , select the most workable of the multiple choices .
This narrative promises so much : freedom , happiness , success .
Robert Frost once said that , &quot; It is poetry that is lost in translation . &quot;
Rather , it teaches us when and how to act .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And I can &apos;t decide .
And one was called &quot; Ballet Slippers . &quot;
And the other one was called &quot; Adorable . &quot;
&quot; Well , it &apos;s a very elegant shade of pink . &quot;
&quot; Okay , great . &quot;
The other lady tells me to wear &quot; Adorable . &quot;
&quot; What does it look like ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a glamorous shade of pink . &quot;
And so I asked them , &quot; Well , how do I tell them apart ?
What &apos;s different about them ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; Well , one is elegant , the other one &apos;s glamorous . &quot;
Okay , we got that .
Thank you . Sheena Iyengar . Thank you Sheena .
And I was like , &quot; Sure . &quot;
In fact , I went to Nashville .
And after a few months I was writing songs .
&#91; Chinese &#93; Outside your door the world is waiting .
Inside your heart a voice is calling .
Go get it , girl .
And I &apos;ve played thousands of shows .
And I see the power of music .
It &apos;s just incredible .
And this little girl comes up to me .
And I sat down , she sat on my lap .
She started singing her song .
Thank you .
Kevin Kelly : How technology evolves
So it sums up a lot of what we &apos;re talking about .
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud .
So he &apos;s saying , what do genes want ? The selfish gene .
We have really no idea .
And the last thing , I bring back this nudibranch .
And so , remarkably , I discovered that there &apos;s also a drift toward specialization .
There &apos;s obviously diversity . Huge numbers of things .
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products .
Well , this is actually what we &apos;re headed towards : world machines .
But as a sideline , he happens to collect cornets .
This is his chart , which is not quite published yet .
And it turns out that , in fact , technologies don &apos;t die .
They &apos;re not around anymore . &quot; Well actually , they are .
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way .
And the answer is : all of them .
So we &apos;ve all heard about the Amish giving up cars .
We &apos;ve heard about the Japanese giving up guns .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s for . It &apos;s so that ideas don &apos;t die out .
It &apos;s accelerating the way in which we search for ideas .
That is what we call an &quot; infinite game . &quot;
That &apos;s the definition . There was no temperature .
Those are all basically the same thing .
Differences , freedom , choices , possibilities .
Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film .
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals .
That &apos;s what technology really wants .
Our humanity is actually defined by technology .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
That &apos;s what technology wants .
That recursive nature is the infinite game .
Thank you .
Paolo Cardini : Forget multitasking , try monotasking
But how efficient is , really , this multitasking ?
Let &apos;s consider for a while the option of monotasking .
A couple of examples .
Look at that .
This is my multitasking activity result .
But what about ourselves , and what about our reality ?
Thank you .
Diana Laufenberg : How to learn ? From mistakes
But the information was closer to me .
I could get access to it .
I didn &apos;t tell them what to do or how to do it .
They produced flyers . They called offices .
They checked schedules . They were meeting with secretaries .
&quot; She doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s in for . &quot;
I had to just sit and watch .
It was theirs . It was experiential . It was authentic .
It meant something to them .
And they will step up .
Luckily , I didn &apos;t have to teach them American government .
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography .
Again , &quot; thrilled &quot; to learn .
There was no expense cost . Perfect field trip .
It &apos;s the first time we &apos;d done this .
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania , where I find myself today .
But I gave them the room to just do the thing .
Go create . Go figure it out .
Let &apos;s see what we can do .
And they immediately went , &quot; There it is . &quot;
Didn &apos;t read anything . &quot; There it is . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Go read it . &quot;
Ask them really interesting questions .
They will not disappoint .
Technology &apos;s long tail
The first is the critical price .
The next phase it hit was displacement .
And then finally , DVDs are approaching free .
Start with gene sequencing .
That &apos;s as opposed to billions just a few years ago .
Today it &apos;s less than 50 cents a day .
Linux is another good example .
Now we &apos;ve switched to critical mass .
The crossover that &apos;s going to matter is the one with the blue .
It &apos;s not just for the geeks any more .
It &apos;s going to look a little bit like that .
And finally , free . Free is really , really interesting .
It &apos;s an economic force ; it &apos;s a technical force .
It is abundance , as opposed to scarcity .
Free is probably the most interesting thing .
And you &apos;ve seen the numbers .
It &apos;s seven cents a minute , in many cases .
Thank you .
Failure of leadership .
What is the failure of leadership today ?
Let &apos;s start from the beginning .
Let &apos;s start from democracy .
I &apos;m the younger one there , to the side .
Soldiers storm the door .
They find me up on the top terrace .
Well , we survived , but democracy did not .
Let me tell you a story .
Sunday evening , Brussels , April 2010 .
But time we didn &apos;t get .
Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels .
Let &apos;s deliberate a little bit longer . &quot;
We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes .
We were led by our fears .
There will be havoc in the markets again . &quot;
Since leaving office , I have had time to reflect .
So let &apos;s try something else .
Let &apos;s throw democracy at the problem .
&quot; Idiot &quot; comes from the root &quot; idio , &quot; oneself .
They serve the demos , democracy .
How do we democratize globalization ?
It is in their interest that all of us are idiots .
Let &apos;s not be .
Thank you .
How do you reconcile that ?
George , thank you for coming to TED .
GP : Thank you very much . Thank you .
JR : One year of turning the world inside out
I asked a question last year : Can art change the world ?
So there has been a lot of change .
You are going to take the photos .
You &apos;re going to send them to me .
This is Inside Out .
One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year .
And we keep sending more every day .
This is the size .
This one was from Haiti .
Boom ! This is what happened .
Karachi , Pakistan .
Sharmeen is actually here .
And I want to thank her today .
The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights .
And he &apos;s here also today .
People , energy , make the glue , organize the team .
It was amazing .
There are tons of school projects .
Education is so essential .
There should be even more schools doing this kind of project .
Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine .
They were all holding their photo as a statement .
It &apos;s everywhere .
So back to the question , &quot; Can art change the world ? &quot;
But maybe we should change the question .
Can art change people &apos;s lives ?
And you know what ? It &apos;s just the beginning .
Let &apos;s turn the world inside out together .
Thank you .
Scilla Elworthy : Fighting with nonviolence
Fight back ? Give in ?
Use more force ?
has been with me ever since I was a child .
And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to Budapest . &quot;
And she said , &quot; What on Earth for ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Kids are getting killed there .
There &apos;s something terrible happening . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Don &apos;t be so silly . &quot;
And I started to cry .
You &apos;re much too young to help .
But just unpack your suitcase . &quot;
So what does work ?
And what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that .
When do I give in ?
What will I stand up for ?
They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns .
But she told the students to sit down .
And no one got killed .
But we have to practice .
So what about our fear ?
I have a little mantra .
You &apos;re the adult .
The fear is the child .
How can this be made better ?
How can the child feel stronger ?
And you make a plan .
Half-past seven , we &apos;re getting up and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . &quot;
So I did the thing .
So that &apos;s fear . What about anger ?
Totally ineffective .
They are human beings just like us .
And they &apos;re doing what they think is best .
And that &apos;s the basis on which we have to talk with them .
So that &apos;s the third one , anger .
This century there &apos;s a shift .
It &apos;s bottom-up or grassroots power .
It &apos;s like mushrooms coming through concrete .
They know best what to do .
So the training of the troops has to change .
The British military have always been much better at this .
And complete silence fell .
And after about two minutes , everybody moved aside and went home .
Now that to me is wisdom in action .
In the moment , that &apos;s what he did .
And it &apos;s happening everywhere now .
You don &apos;t believe me ?
And this hasn &apos;t just happened .
And it &apos;s been translated into 26 languages .
It &apos;s flown around the world .
Now I don &apos;t just believe in non-violence .
I don &apos;t have to believe in it .
Thank you .
Gever Tulley : 5 dangerous things you should let your kids do
I don &apos;t have children .
I &apos;m Gever Tulley .
So we build a lot of things .
So where does this trend stop ?
The book is called &quot; 50 Dangerous Things . &quot;
This is five dangerous things .
Thing number one -- play with fire .
So , playing with fire .
Number two -- own a pocketknife .
These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber .
And yeah , they &apos;re going to cut themselves .
Number three -- throw a spear .
So those are great .
Number four -- deconstruct appliances .
It &apos;s a sense of knowability , that something is knowable .
Number five -- two-parter .
Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
You &apos;ve just broken a law .
So -- and it &apos;s perfectly legal .
It &apos;s very safe actually .
And it &apos;s fun for the whole family .
So , let &apos;s see .
Mike Matas : A next-generation digital book
The book starts like this . This is the cover .
Zoom into it and see where it was taken .
So you can open this one .
MM : It starts playing immediately .
This is one of my favorites .
So this shows ...
It also runs on the iPhone .
And it works the exact same way .
You can pinch into any page .
Open it up .
Thank you .
That &apos;s spectacular .
What is the business here ?
Is this something that other people can do ?
All right . Mike , thanks so much .
MM : Thank you .
This is the patent .
So we turn to the field of vaccines .
That &apos;s a pretty hard act to beat .
I share that view .
These are early deaths that take place .
Now , this is a specimen of the Nanopatch .
So that &apos;s a very important function tied in with the Nanopatch .
It &apos;s a spring-operated device .
And indeed we can make a reuse of the applicator itself .
So let &apos;s start with the first one , this immunogenicity idea .
So it does that well .
And we see this kind of data .
It &apos;s off the grid entirely .
So what if you &apos;ve targeted cells ?
In the world of vaccines , what does that mean ?
The world of vaccines is getting better .
It &apos;s getting more systematic .
So , we had to do that gamble .
So on the horizontal axis we have the dose shown in nanograms .
That &apos;s a real fresh opportunity .
Suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines .
Now , the stakes are very high .
That &apos;s an important improvement .
We &apos;re delighted about it as well .
We &apos;ve started with Papua New Guinea .
That &apos;s a challenge .
Now , doing this kind of work is not easy .
Thank you .
Julie Burstein : 4 lessons in creativity
This one is more than 400 years old .
Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity .
It was supposed to break , but that &apos;s okay .
Julie Burstein : Isn &apos;t that a wonderful story ?
That &apos;s a tough space to stand in .
and she said , &quot; Probably never . &quot;
My office was just a few blocks away .
Time is unstoppable , and it transforms the event .
Thank you .
Justin Hall-Tipping : Freeing energy from the grid
Why can &apos;t we solve these problems ?
We know what they are .
Something always seems to stop us .
Why ?
I remember March the 15th , 2000 .
The B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf .
I &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s nothing normal about this .
Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness .
In winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
How is that possible ?
You think of carbon as black .
Carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible .
We &apos;d have to see at night , right ?
This lets you do it .
Transparency is key .
And then I &apos;m going to turn the lights out .
The power plant of tomorrow is no power plant .
We talked about generating and using .
We said , &quot; Could you build this ? &quot;
And what they built was eBox .
It &apos;s my energy .
These also require tremendous amounts of energy .
We &apos;re simply not going to do that .
By any standard this is wrong .
It &apos;s just wrong .
We can do better than this .
We should do better than this .
You don &apos;t have enough time .
Thank you .
Damon Horowitz : We need a &quot; moral operating system &quot;
Power .
That is the word that comes to mind .
We &apos;re the new technologists .
How much power do we have ?
Scene from a movie : &quot; Apocalypse Now &quot; -- great movie .
Let &apos;s take an example .
What can we do with that guy &apos;s data ?
I can look at your financial records .
I know if you &apos;re good to give a loan to .
I can look at your clicking patterns .
What &apos;s the right thing to do ?
Fair enough .
But it brings me back .
So we can make money ?
Which one is it ?
How should we figure it out ?
I know : crowdsource . Let &apos;s crowdsource this .
Let &apos;s do a show of hands -- iPhone .
Uh huh .
Android .
Next question , a little bit harder .
Or should we leave him alone ?
Collect his data .
Leave him alone .
You &apos;re safe . It &apos;s fine .
Kant .
Mill .
Not as many votes .
Yeah , that &apos;s a terrifying result .
What &apos;s a moral operating system ?
But how do we figure out what &apos;s right and wrong ?
Maybe we just follow our gut .
Maybe we take a vote -- we crowdsource .
So let &apos;s get a moral framework .
I know a guy who did exactly that .
A brilliant guy -- he &apos;s been dead 2,500 years .
Plato , that &apos;s right .
You were sleeping during that class .
He was worried about right and wrong .
He wanted to know what is just .
I don &apos;t want opinions ; I want knowledge .
In math , we know the objective facts .
Take a number , any number -- two .
Favorite number . I love that number .
There are truths about two .
They all have two-ness in them .
What if there were a pure form of justice ?
It wouldn &apos;t be a matter of just opinion or just appearances .
That &apos;s a stunning vision .
That &apos;s as ambitious as we are .
He wants to solve ethics .
He wants objective truths .
Aristotle , in particular , he was not amused .
He thought it was impractical .
Aristotle thought ethics wasn &apos;t a lot like math .
But don &apos;t give up .
That sound familiar ?
That &apos;s a utilitarian moral framework .
But here &apos;s the way it works .
It does something intrinsic to the act .
It &apos;s just a matter of the consequences .
Let &apos;s take an example .
I thought , that guy looks suspicious .
Maybe you think , it &apos;s his phone .
He has autonomy .
It &apos;s not a matter of calculation .
So let &apos;s stop .
We &apos;re right in the thick of it , this philosophical thicket .
So let &apos;s cut to the chase .
How should we be making our decisions ?
What should we be doing ? What &apos;s the answer ?
What &apos;s the formula ?
There &apos;s not a formula .
There &apos;s not a simple answer .
Ethics is hard .
Ethics requires thinking .
And that &apos;s uncomfortable .
But they can &apos;t .
We &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
So let &apos;s do that . Let &apos;s think .
In fact , let &apos;s start right now .
Or now we have a few more choices .
Are you ready ? Go .
Stop . Good work .
Now the next step -- try this .
Do it over lunch .
In fact , find somebody from the humanities .
It &apos;s based on Norse legend .
That &apos;s interesting .
And we care about right and wrong .
We care what happens in that opera .
We &apos;re the ones writing this opera .
This is our movie .
We figure out what will happen with this technology .
We determine how this will all end .
Thank you .
Herbie Hancock : An all-star set
Herbie Hancock : Thank you .

Harvey Mason .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Genital stimulation . Duh .
It &apos;s so sad .
You gotta love that . Rutgers .
It was remarkable . It took about one minute .
There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex .
It &apos;s like this . You trigger the spot .
The dead guy , or gal , goes ... like that .
Obviously it wouldn &apos;t be as much fun for the person .
I said , &quot; You should actually do this . &quot;
Very heavy hetero guy .
Nothing seemed to help .
And lo and behold , the hiccups went away .
Married , single , unattached hiccupper .
It was called the &quot; upsuck &quot; theory .
They didn &apos;t buy it .
This is the 1950s .
And they masturbated .
This one said , &quot; Yield : one ejaculate . &quot;
This one involves men .
Okay .
And I got a copy of this DVD .
So uh , okay .
It all looks very innocent .
And the happy result .
I love this video .
Why don &apos;t you have the farmers do that ?
They tend to -- pigs , for example , are more like dogs .
This is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque .
They developed an artificial coition machine .
And the woman would have sex with it .
That is what they would do . Pretty amazing .
Sadly , this device has been dismantled .
This was not idle curiosity .
Yes . Exactly .
Thank you very much .
Thanks !
David Byrne , Ethel + Thomas Dolby : &quot; Flowers &quot; with string quartet
Rachel Sussman : The world &apos;s oldest living things
This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta .
It also happens to be a relative of parsley .
The project is part art and part science .
There &apos;s an environmental component .
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project .
So it was the slow churn , if you will .
It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet .
And then , of course , there &apos;s the lichens .
So this strategy has served it pretty well -- it &apos;s 2,400 years old .
And then from underground to underwater .
This is a clonal tree as well .
As it &apos;s gotten warmer on the top of the mountain , the vegetation zone is actually changing .
And aside from coral , the answer is no .
And back to the yew here .
And now down to another part of the world .
It &apos;s around 2,000 , and it &apos;s called the Sagole Baobab .
And what &apos;s more , it &apos;s actually a tree .
It &apos;s a primitive conifer .
This is something called an underground forest .
The tree can easily recover .
This is the clonal Creosote bush , which is around 12,000 years old .
And what &apos;s happening is it &apos;s expanding slowly outwards from that original shape .
And there &apos;s some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it .
You &apos;ll see also , there &apos;s a flag on Antarctica .
Thank you .
Daniel Suarez : The kill decision shouldn &apos;t belong to a robot
There &apos;s actually a technical term for this : lethal autonomy .
And actually , they &apos;re very quickly becoming a reality .
That &apos;s because the way humans resolve conflict shapes our social landscape .
And this has always been the case , throughout history .
Power was focused at the very top .
And what changed ? Technological innovation .
Gunpowder , cannon .
Representative government began to form .
But time is a factor .
Now we live in a global economy .
High-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents .
But I think the truth is the exact opposite .
Data powers high-tech societies .
Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals .
Notice that certain individuals are highlighted .
These are the hubs of social networks .
And it could set the stage for global action .
I think the secret will be transparency .
We have license plates on cars , tail numbers on aircraft .
This is no different .
Let &apos;s not succumb to the temptation to automate war .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And this isn &apos;t just a problem in Britain .
Since then , what &apos;s happened ?
What is wrong with the people that we have chosen ?
Why should we get away from those arguments ?
It is a state of mind . It is an activity .
And part of that activity is honesty .
It &apos;s a question of what the citizens do .
Thank you very much indeed .
Please raise your hand -- oh , that &apos;s a lot .
In the last year ?
A lot goes to the U.K. , Germany .
And I spent about three years researching .
In total , they weigh 103.7 kilograms .
And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops .
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice .
It &apos;s really a sort of magical moment .
And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic .
In total , I found 185 products .
Thank you very much .
Malcolm Gladwell : The strange tale of the Norden bombsight
Thank you .
It &apos;s a real pleasure to be here .
I talked about spaghetti sauce .
And the man &apos;s name is Carl Norden .
Carl Norden was born in 1880 .
And he was Swiss .
He &apos;s an engineer .
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich .
And he &apos;s a Swiss engineer , Carl .
It &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
The bombsights that were available were incredibly crude .
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device .
It weighs about 50 lbs .
It &apos;s called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight .
And he makes this complicated thing .
It was like manna from heaven .
And what was God &apos;s will ?
And what did the Norden bombsight do ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It &apos;s never allowed to be photographed .
The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail .
So what happens during the Second World War ?
Well , it turns out it &apos;s not the Holy Grail .
And of course , in wartime , conditions aren &apos;t perfect .
Secondly , it breaks down a lot .
But of course , what happens in real life ?
There are clouds , right .
Not a lot .
And the chemical plant comprised 757 acres .
10 percent . 10 percent .
They &apos;ve invented websites that will allow people to be free .
You know what the answer was ?
Zero , not a single one .
Now why is that ?
Is it because their weapons weren &apos;t accurate ?
Oh no , they were brilliantly accurate .
That &apos;s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .
Or take the battle in Afghanistan .
It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision .
Now what is the accuracy of those drones ?
Well it &apos;s extraordinary .
But of course , it didn &apos;t matter .
He was a committed Christian .
It would have broken his heart .
Sarah-Jayne Blakemore : The mysterious workings of the adolescent brain
It can go on a long time .
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area .
So this is a soccer game .
Now your task is to move objects around .
So we sometimes laugh about teenagers .
It gives you the kick out of taking risks .
It &apos;s a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity .
Paul Rothemund : Playing with DNA that self-assembles
And so this idea has a lot of traction with us .
So that &apos;s great . So that was too easy .
So now , the thing is that this is a different kind of spell .
A computer magician can write this thing .
And a lot of them are actually pretty good .
Monika Bulaj : The hidden light of Afghanistan
I met humble people .
I heard their prayer and ate their bread .
And I ever met more humble people .
And I shared their bread and their prayer .
This is why I went to Afghanistan .
One day , I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River .
I was alone on foot .
But he gave me a cup of tea .
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war ?
Thanks .
The numbers tell the story quite clearly .
190 heads of state -- nine are women .
A recent study in the U.S.
How do we change these numbers at the top ?
How do we make this different ?
What are the messages we need to tell ourselves ?
What are the messages we tell our daughters ?
I don &apos;t have the right answer .
I don &apos;t even have it for myself .
This is hard . I feel guilty sometimes .
One , sit at the table .
Two , make your partner a real partner .
And three , don &apos;t leave before you leave .
Number one : sit at the table .
And everyone kind of sat at the table .
Don &apos;t you love that kind of thing from college ?
I wish I could do that now .
The three of us take this class together .
My brother is kind of busy .
The three of us go to the exam together , and we sit down .
&quot; You got the top grade in the class ?
You don &apos;t know anything . &quot;
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce .
Obviously . Why are you even asking ? &quot;
Why does this matter ?
I wish the answer were easy .
Own your own success . &quot;
But it &apos;s not that simple .
But that one word made a really big difference .
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard .
You want to spend the day fishing with him .
But Heidi ? Not so sure .
She &apos;s a little out for herself . She &apos;s a little political .
This is the complication .
I said , okay , and she sat down , and we talked .
I learned that I need to keep my hand up . &quot;
I said , &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
We &apos;ve got to get women to sit at the table .
Message number two : make your partner a real partner .
The data shows this very clearly .
I think the cause is more complicated .
Message number three : don &apos;t leave before you leave .
She starts leaning back .
She didn &apos;t even have a boyfriend .
I said , &quot; You &apos;re thinking about this just way too early . &quot;
It needs to be rewarding .
You need to feel like you &apos;re making a difference .
Don &apos;t leave before you leave .
Stay in .
They &apos;re just not moving .
I have two children .
Thank you .
Daniel H. Cohen : For argument &apos;s sake
And what that means is that I argue .
But I also like to think a lot about arguing .
Well , there &apos;s some other puzzles .
Yeah , we have those arguments too .
But those aren &apos;t the important arguments .
So why do we even try to argue ?
Think of a mathematician &apos;s argument .
Does the conclusion follow from the premises ?
We want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order .
We want killer arguments .
That &apos;s the kind of argument we want .
It is the dominant way of thinking about arguments .
First it elevates tactics over substance .
You can take a class in logic , argumentation .
We don &apos;t get anywhere .
And let me explain what I mean .
Suppose you and I have an argument .
And I say , &quot; Well why do you believe P ? &quot;
And you give me your reasons .
And I object and say , &quot; Well , what about ... ? &quot;
And you answer my objection .
This guy &apos;s a good arguer .
We need to think of new kinds of arguments .
That &apos;s the bad news .
I don &apos;t have an answer .
So try this .
There &apos;s the audience in rhetorical arguments .
There &apos;s the reasoner in arguments as proofs .
Now , I lose a lot of arguments .
Thank you .
Raghava KK : Shake up your story
Hi everyone .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a children &apos;s book for the iPad .
It &apos;s a little quirky and silly .
You can tickle the rug .
You can make the baby poop .
You can do all those fun things .
You can burst bubbles .
It &apos;s not the way I was brought up .
You don &apos;t like it ?
Shake it , and you have a lesbian couple .
Basically , I celebrated every religious function .
It was a very beautiful time .
I &apos;m like , &quot; Dude , I &apos;m Hindu . &quot;
He &apos;s like , &quot; Huh ! &quot;
Imagine history being taught differently .
I have another idea .
You have to separate fact from bias , right .
But they &apos;re playing geopolitics .
They &apos;re playing out Israel-Palestine , India-Pakistan .
You know , I &apos;m making a very important argument .
Thank you very much .
Margaret Heffernan : Dare to disagree
Now , she had no idea what to look for .
Had they consumed colored drinks ?
Did they eat fish and chips ?
Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
In fact , she need not have hurried .
Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
George frankly preferred numbers to people .
He actively sought disconfirmation .
Alice and George were very good at conflict .
They saw it as thinking .
That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
So how do organizations think ?
Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
They can &apos;t think together .
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
They think of him as a leader .
Openness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .
I &apos;m a very lucky person .
What an amazing experience .
And it made me want to explore more .
Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar .
You see them all the time , you think .
Lots of snow in which to dig a den .
KB : I love that shot .
I always get goosebumps every time I see it .
But technology alone isn &apos;t enough .
And that sequence was especially difficult .
The first year we got nothing .
And eventually we got lucky .
It depends solely on the bat .
See what you think .
The tube-lipped nectar bat .
But how to reach it ?
Necessity is the mother of evolution .
KB : What a tongue .
And the truth is I just don &apos;t have one .
There are so many wonderful places .
But at 15,000 feet , it &apos;s tough .
And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover .
Have a look .
Where deserts freeze and waters boil .
Dan Buettner : How to live to be 100 +
You have the USDA food pyramid .
There is what Oprah tells us .
There is what Doctor Oz tells us .
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga ?
Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ?
When it comes to supplements , should you be taking them ?
How about these hormones or resveratrol ?
And does purpose play into it ?
Spirituality ? And how about how we socialize ?
False .
Your chances are very low .
The problem is that we &apos;re not programmed for longevity .
We are programmed for something called procreative success .
I love that word .
It reminds me of my college days .
After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates .
False .
When you think of it , there is 99 things that can age us .
There is just too many things to go wrong .
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
And it builds up exponentially .
Well , the same things happen to our cells .
But life expectancy in this country is only 78 .
These are years that we could get .
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ .
It &apos;s called Cannonau .
Just look at the advertisements .
That &apos;s called the grandmother effect .
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands .
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found .
They have what we want .
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America .
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease .
What do they do ?
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it .
It was invented by Confucius .
And that diet is known as the Hara , Hatchi , Bu diet .
We know that isolation kills .
We &apos;re down to one and half right now .
Their average age is 102 .
There is our work life , where we &apos;re productive .
And then one day , boom , we retire .
Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life , and that word is &quot; ikigai . &quot;
And , roughly translated , it means &quot; the reason for which you wake up in the morning . &quot;
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning .
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years .
I thought that was a wonderful thought .
But that &apos;s because all the young people left .
So , we turned to the data again .
Adventists are conservative Methodists .
A &quot; 24-hour sanctuary in time , &quot; they call it .
This is a heterogeneous community .
They take their diet directly from the Bible .
They take this sanctuary in time very serious .
None of it &apos;s hard . None of it costs money .
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham .
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old .
And then Marge Deton .
Marge is 104 .
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here .
She starts her day with lifting weights .
She rides her bicycle .
I &apos;ve been on 19 hardcore expeditions .
So , what are the common denominators in these three cultures ?
What are the things that they all do ?
And we managed to boil it down to nine .
They don &apos;t have any conveniences .
That &apos;s physical activity .
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does .
Each of these cultures take time to downshift .
The Sardinians pray . The Seventh-Day Adventists pray .
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration .
There &apos;s no longevity diet .
They tend to eat a plant-based diet .
They put their families first , take care of their children and their aging parents .
Murray Gell- The ancestor of language
In fact , mostly now in other things .
And the professional , historical linguists in the U.S.
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
Well , Philip Anderson may have been right .
So , it &apos;s been an honor . Thank you Murray Gell-Mann .
But trust me , I work in advertising .
It &apos;s actually Bitcoin .
He &apos;s almost like the Banksy of the Internet .
So it &apos;s not run by the authorities or the state .
It &apos;s actually managed by the network .
&quot; Sub-prime pedaling . &quot; &quot; Barclays takes you for a ride . &quot;
And I find that sort of scary .
So you think about loyalty .
Loyalty essentially is a micro-economy .
You think about rewards schemes , air miles .
It &apos;s 50 percent above the category average .
When they spot Tide , there &apos;s a shortcut .
There were 8,000 kinds of notes in America .
Is technology making paper money feel outmoded ?
Are we decoupling money from the government ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Maya Beiser : A cello with many voices
Thank you .
It all became music to me .
I didn &apos;t hear the boundaries .
Skylar Tibbits : The emergence of &quot; 4D printing &quot;
But there is another world .
In infrastructure , let &apos;s just take one example .
Take piping .
We bury them in the ground .
We need a few simple ingredients .
And then we embed elastic .
And we built 500 of these glass beakers .
This is the polio virus .
These are parts being printed with multi-material properties .
Here &apos;s the first demonstration .
I &apos;m biased .
So no human interaction .
One of those is in extreme environments .
And space is a great example of that .
Let &apos;s go back to infrastructure .
And we &apos;re developing a new paradigm for piping .
Thank you .
Arthur Ganson : Moving sculpture
And the ideas are very disparate .
So , I was able to sort of exercise all of that .
It &apos;s really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality .
That &apos;s pretty ambiguous .
I gave myself the problem .
And that &apos;s a little found object .
I imagine what can be said with them .
And that &apos;s the whole piece .
That &apos;s about that big .
Because it could run all the time .
Now , a completely different thought .
I &apos;m always imagining myself in different situations .
I &apos;m imagining myself as a machine .
What would I love ?
I would love to be bathed in oil .
It &apos;s definitely happy .
So this is a little wire-bending tool .
And that was that tool .
I just like , throw it in .
So , that &apos;s a finished gear .
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner .
But I had a lot of fun .
It means nothing at all .
The object itself just means nothing .
So I &apos;ll just let this chair come down .
Thank you .
Hetain Patel : Who am I ? Think again
I have asked her to translate for me .
Okay .
Be formless , shapeless , like water .
Now you put water into a cup .
It becomes the cup .
Put it in a teapot , it becomes the teapot .
Now , water can flow or it can crash .
Be water , my friend .
HP : Don &apos;t imitate my voice .
It offends me .
I have .
At first , it was going very well .
I even started to get discounts in Indian shops .
It didn &apos;t look Indian anymore .
My dad doesn &apos;t even have an Indian accent anymore .
He talks like this now .
I said , &quot; What ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes . So ? &quot;
This is my art .
I learned this from Spider-Man .
Thank you .
So this is a real human brain .
But other than that , the two hemispheres are completely separate .
Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy . Assistant : It has been .
Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment .
It &apos;s all about &quot; right here , right now . &quot;
And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
I need them in the morning . &quot;
You muscles , you relax . &quot;
And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; What is wrong with me ?
We got a problem ! We gotta get some help . &quot;
And I &apos;m going , &quot; Ahh ! I got a problem .
And I felt this sense of peacefulness .
Oh ! I felt euphoria -- euphoria . It was beautiful .
I gotta focus . &quot;
Can I drive ? Can I drive ? &quot;
And the next thing my brain says to me is , &quot; Wow !
This is so cool . &quot; &quot; This is so cool !
&quot; I don &apos;t have time for a stroke ! &quot;
So I gotta call help . I gotta call work . &quot;
And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity .
And I curl up into a little fetal ball .
I am the life-force power of the universe .
And I thought that was an idea worth spreading .
Tim Leberecht : 3 ways to lose control of your brand
Companies are losing control .
But are they really ?
They can listen and join the conversation .
They can design for it . But how ?
Take the travel service Nextpedition .
Force them to help others .
Thank you .
Jacqueline Novogratz : Inspiring a life of immersion
On the one hand , people say , &quot; The time for change is now . &quot;
They want to be part of it .
I work in global poverty .
Will I be marginalized ?
Will I not make enough money ?
Will I never get married or have children ? &quot;
Your job is only to be human .
We don &apos;t talk about the sacrifice .
&quot; Better immersion than to live untouched . &quot;
What is the cost of not trying ?
She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide .
And they &apos;re incredible guys .
And they &apos;re doing it .
And my hat &apos;s off to you in Kibera .
I know it works .
It took almost two years just to register the land .
And there &apos;s schools and clinics and shops .
But there &apos;s only one mosque .
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Long story .
And every day we have a choice .
And he would say , &quot; Ruby , what are you saying ? &quot;
And she &apos;d say , &quot; I &apos;m not talking . &quot;
What are you saying ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , what are you praying ? &quot;
We need leaders .
Thank you .
Aimee Mullins : Changing my legs - and my mindset
Why don &apos;t we start there ?
So , why don &apos;t you tell that story ?
I played softball for five years growing up .
That &apos;s all I &apos;d ever known .
You were all over the place .
We all saw how hard you were working . &quot;
He &apos;s just a rather intimidating figure .
&quot; Can I just sit in and see what you do ? &quot;
So that &apos;s how I met Frank .
You can run on our women &apos;s track team here . &quot;
And I said , &quot; No , come on . &quot;
And he said , &quot; No , no , really . You can .
You can run with our women &apos;s track team . &quot;
So I don &apos;t know , it started to become an interesting mix .
Why don &apos;t you just tell them ?
It was really , really hot .
And he just sat there like this .
He kept me on the right track .
It &apos;s now two years that you &apos;ve been running ?
AM : No , a year .
AM : Okay , well , Atlanta .
And so , here I am -- never lost .
I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump .
No , I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter .
And I &apos;m sure of it , you know ?
It was , like , this is my time for shine .
It &apos;s my first international meet .
&quot; Oh , Aimee , we &apos;ll have to get back to you on that one . &quot;
I wanted to find out times .
&quot; Don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re doing great . &quot;
I &apos;m sitting there , like , &quot; Oh , my god . Oh , my god . &quot;
And Georgetown -- that was great .
SS : Why don &apos;t you show them your legs ?
AM : Oh , sure .
AM : Well , these are my pretty legs .
You &apos;ve got to come up and see them .
And , seriously , like , I can wear heels .
SS : You got to pick your height ?
AM : I got to pick my height , exactly .
You can be eight feet tall . Just take them off . &quot;
No , I &apos;ve got so many legs in here .
These are -- do you want to hold that actually ?
SS : Are you a different height ?
AM : In these ?
SS : In these .
AM : I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t think so .
AM : Yes , we &apos;ll do that .
SS : Yes , there you go .
They &apos;re also silicon .
This is a really basic , basic prosthetic limb under here .
It &apos;s like a Barbie foot under this .
And this is just a silicon piece of skin .
I mean , they make ears for burn victims .
They do amazing stuff with silicon .
SS : For 45 minutes . Luckily , the hotel was terrific .
I need a little bit off . &quot;
They didn &apos;t even want to touch that one . They just did it .
No , these legs are great .
So ... Moderator : That &apos;s it .
SS : That &apos;s Aimee Mullins .
Joshua Walters : On being just crazy enough
My name is Joshua Walters .
I &apos;m a performer .
They &apos;re just practicing .
Okay ? Mmhmm ?
Some of you are in the field , I can see .
I can feel your noise .
When I got out I had a choice .
And there &apos;s a book -- John Gartner .
So it wasn &apos;t all the good side of the illness .
Your call . Your call .
And everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
Everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
Maybe no one &apos;s really crazy .
Everyone is just a little bit mad .
Thank you .
Rebecca MacKinnon : Let &apos;s take back the Internet !
We shall prevail .
So here &apos;s the thing .
So here &apos;s the situation .
Today , things are a lot more subtle . &quot;
So we assume that the Internet is a border-busting technology .
But that &apos;s only half of the story .
We need to make the same approach with the Internet .
We also are going to need political innovation .
And what does that look like ?
At the moment , we still don &apos;t know .
Thank you very much .
Sugata Mitra : Build a School in the Cloud
What is going to be the future of learning ?
But the Victorians actually did it .
What they did was amazing .
It &apos;s still with us today .
It &apos;s called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
They must be identical to each other .
The Victorians were great engineers .
I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re broken .
It &apos;s not broken . It &apos;s wonderfully constructed .
What are the kind of jobs that we have today ?
Well , the clerks are the computers .
They &apos;re there in thousands in every office .
Those people don &apos;t need to be able to write beautifully by hand .
They do need to be able to read .
In fact , they need to be able to read discerningly .
Well , I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident .
Or should they not ?
And my daughter -- oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot;
What did the poor do wrong ?
The children came running in .
I said , &quot; Just like that . &quot;
And I went away .
My colleagues said , &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple solution .
So I said , &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot;
I repeated the experiment there .
On your right is an eight-year-old .
And he &apos;s teaching her how to browse .
So I started publishing .
So then people said , well , how far will it go ?
Where does it stop ?
I made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis .
&quot; And anyway , I am going away . &quot;
So I left them for a couple of months .
So I said , &quot; Well , what did I expect ? &quot;
So they said , &quot; We haven &apos;t given up .
We look at it every single day . &quot;
So I tested them .
Thirty percent is a fail .
So she says , &quot; Absolutely not .
So she says , &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Stand behind them .
So she did that for two more months .
The scores jumped to 50 percent .
Here &apos;s Kallikuppam .
Neurons ... communication .
At 12 .
So what are jobs going to be like ?
Well , we know what they &apos;re like today .
What will it be tomorrow ?
Could it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
But look at it this way .
What an achievement that is .
Encouragement seems to be the key .
There is evidence from neuroscience .
Why did they create a system like that ?
Because it was needed .
If you didn &apos;t , you failed .
But the Age of Empires is gone .
I got 200 in the first two weeks .
They &apos;re called the Granny Cloud .
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet .
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out .
&quot; Shhh . &quot;
Okay ?
Watch this .
You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me .
Grandmother : Well done ! Very good .
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about letting it happen .
But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools .
Here &apos;s a SOLE in action .
This one is in England .
SM : A decade ahead of her time .
But that &apos;s not sexy enough .
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs .
So what &apos;s my wish ?
Help me build this school .
It will be called the School in the Cloud .
It &apos;s a facility which is practically unmanned .
The rest of it &apos;s from the cloud .
But I want you for another purpose .
That &apos;s my wish .
And just one last thing .
I &apos;ll take you to the top of the Himalayas .
I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot;
I think it was good advice .
I &apos;ll follow her advice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you very much . Wow .
Nathan Wolfe : What &apos;s left to explore ?
Recently I visited Beloit , Wisconsin .
He was quite a figure .
Don &apos;t try that one .
But is that really the case ?
Basically we have no clue what this is .
And there &apos;s a lot of it .
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact .
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a rare condition .
I can see it in their eyes .
They want to ask me something .
I &apos;m an extreme example of this .
One is a flash of white light .
Six is a tiny and very sad black hole .
Three is green .
Four is blue .
Five is yellow .
I paint as well .
It &apos;s a multiplication of two prime numbers .
What about bigger numbers ?
But it &apos;s not only numbers that I see in colors .
And this is an opening phrase from the novel &quot; Lolita . &quot;
And Nabokov was himself synesthetic .
Another example : a little bit more mathematical .
64 multiplied by 75 .
What about 75 ?
64 becomes 6,400 .
Four across , four up and down -- it &apos;s 16 .
Easy when you know how .
The second question was an Icelandic word .
So let me narrow the choices down to two .
What do you say ?
Okay .
Some people say it &apos;s happy .
Most people , a majority of people , say sad .
And it actually means sad .
Let &apos;s have a look at the third question .
Thank you .
The building was a true bird-killer .
It &apos;s laying dead on its belly .
Both are of the male sex .
And then this happened .
I said , &quot; Something &apos;s wrong here . &quot;
I look . Both are of the male sex .
Homosexual necrophilia .
I didn &apos;t have the framework .
And here &apos;s the situation again .
And here are the ducks again .
But then something good happened .
That &apos;s a good thing , so I accepted the prize .
He called me from Cambridge , Massachusetts .
That &apos;s the first thing .
And there are nine other winners who get prizes .
Dan , where are you ? Dan Ariely ?
Applause for Dan .
Yeah ?
You can pass it around .
After winning this prize , my life changed .
This is a moose .
This is in Montana , 2008 .
This is the Netherlands , 2011 .
These are cane toads in Australia .
This is roadkill .
Please note that this is necrophilia .
It &apos;s remarkable : the position .
The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom .
These are pigeons in Rotterdam .
Barn swallows in Hong Kong , 2004 .
So what does this mean ?
And here you see a dead duck .
It &apos;s been there for three days , and it &apos;s laying on its back .
So there goes my theory of necrophilia .
That &apos;s on June 5 every year .
Thank you .
Oh , sorry .
May I have my duck back , please ?
Thank you .
Dennis Hong : Making a car for blind drivers
We have already an autonomous vehicle .
We couldn &apos;t have been more wrong .
It was an absolutely amazing experience .
So how does it work ?
So we have three steps .
We have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
For that , we use an initial measurement unit .
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip .
Another device is called SpeedStrip .
So these two devices , DriveGrip and SpeedStrip , are very effective .
So this is not really freedom , right ?
We call this the &quot; backseat-driver problem . &quot;
So basically that &apos;s how it works .
We also had some surprises . Let &apos;s take a look .
This is an historic day in January .
He &apos;s coming up to the grandstand , fellow Federationists .
There &apos;s the grandstand now .
Well there comes the first box .
Now let &apos;s see if Mark avoids it .
He &apos;s closing in on the van to make the moving pass .
Dennis Hong : I &apos;m so happy for you .
Mark &apos;s going to give me a ride back to the hotel .
Mark Riccobono : Yes .
You must be out of your mind . &quot;
How are we going to handle insurance ?
How are we going to issue driver &apos;s licenses ?
This is priceless .
Thank you very much .
Quyen Nguyen : Color-coded surgery
In fact , medicine today is a team sport .
And in many ways , it always has been .
This is Mass General in Boston .
So let me back up a little bit .
It &apos;s done , it &apos;s out , you &apos;re cured of cancer .
This is how we excise cancers .
In the meanwhile , the patient &apos;s on the operating room table .
And we wait .
And that may be 20 minutes later per piece .
Please go cut that piece out . &quot;
So we go back and we do that again , and again .
And this whole process : &quot; Okay you &apos;re done .
We think the entire tumor is out . &quot;
There &apos;s still cancer in your patient . &quot;
The molecule they had developed had three parts .
Nothing will be specific .
There &apos;s no specificity there .
So they added two additional components .
The molecule passes through and gets excreted .
Can you tell where the tumor is ?
I couldn &apos;t when I was working on this .
But here it is . It &apos;s fluorescent .
Now it &apos;s green .
The light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue .
And I &apos;m peeling that muscle away .
that &apos;s labeled with fluorescent molecules .
the gas station has gas .
So that takes more time .
Patients are still on the operating room table .
Anesthesiologists , surgeons are waiting around .
That takes time .
So with our technology , we can tell right away .
That doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s cancer inside .
Well you can see this on an MRI .
So it &apos;s very important to avoid inadvertent injury .
And what I &apos;m talking about are nerves .
What &apos;s the problem ?
We haven &apos;t had that many complications . &quot;
But I went ahead anyway .
And Roger helped me .
And he brought his whole team with him .
So there &apos;s that teamwork thing again .
You can see where they are .
We &apos;ve been able to see every single nerve .
When we put these two probes together ...
So here &apos;s a tumor .
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is ?
Now you do .
What about the nerve that &apos;s going into this tumor ?
That white portion there is easy to see .
But what about the part that goes into the tumor ?
Do you know where it &apos;s going ?
Now you do .
This was a bit of a breakthrough .
I think that it &apos;ll change the way that we do surgery .
And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues .
They said , &quot; Wow !
The eventual goal is that we &apos;ll get this into patients .
We are focused on making this technology better .
I &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
Successful innovation is not a single breakthrough .
It is not a sprint .
Thank you very much .
Johanna Blakley : Lessons from fashion &apos;s free culture
She &apos;s an Italian fashion designer .
She &apos;s turning it inside out .
She &apos;s looking at the seams . She &apos;s looking at the construction .
Her friend says , &quot; Buy it already . &quot;
Well , it turns out that it &apos;s actually not illegal .
In the fashion industry , there &apos;s very little intellectual property protection .
But if you go to Santee Alley , yeah .
Well , yeah .
Canal Street , I know .
And sometimes these are fun , right ?
This is Vivienne Westwood . No !
Maybe just a little .
Can &apos;t copyright a costume either .
Here &apos;s what he had to say .
Johanna Blakley : Imagine that .
This is a very different demographic .
There &apos;s lots of virtues of copying .
For fashionistas , they want to stay ahead of the curve .
It forced him to be a little more innovative .
I love these Gallianos .
Okay , we &apos;ll move on .
This is not unlike the world of comedy .
But now , we have a different kind of comic .
They knock themselves off .
Who owns a look ?
That is a very difficult question to answer .
Same with automobiles .
It &apos;s a utilitarian article , that &apos;s why .
Same with furniture , it &apos;s too utilitarian .
Hairdos , no copyright protection .
They share their designs .
Jokes , no copyright protection .
It ain &apos;t pretty .
It &apos;s embarrassing . &quot;
First : Is something an artistic object ?
Then it deserves protection .
Is it a utilitarian object ?
Then no , it does not deserve protection .
This is a difficult , unstable binary .
The other one is : Is it an idea ?
No protection .
It &apos;s a digital file .
They &apos;re smart .
He &apos;s smart , he &apos;s smart .
Thank you so much .
Rory Sutherland : Life lessons from an ad man
It &apos;s held every two years in Burma .
Here is my naive advertising man &apos;s suggestion .
So I &apos;ll ask you another question .
What on earth is wrong with placebos ?
They work extraordinarily well .
The point is that education doesn &apos;t actually work by teaching you things .
So , welcome to Oxford , ladies and gentlemen .
But , actually , the point of placebo education is interesting .
They are absolutely disgusting and they &apos;re good for nothing . &quot;
So he tried plan B.
What he &apos;d effectively done is he &apos;d re-branded the potato .
It was an absolute masterpiece .
Now , boring people would have just simply banned the veil .
Ataturk was a lateral thinker .
He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil .
What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things .
all value is actually relative .
All value is perceived value .
As an advertising man , I have to admire that .
Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion .
Not so in Italy .
And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron .
Here &apos;s one : &quot; Gold gab ich für Eisen , 1813 . &quot;
It was made of cast iron .
It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past .
So , the modern equivalent would of course be this .
Now , we basically have to change our views slightly .
It involves limited raw materials .
It patently veers toward propaganda .
Nowadays , the user is actually involved .
Although it &apos;s called agriculture in the world of food .
In the world of food we call it cooking .
We invented the whole lot of them .
Finally , we have contextual communication .
Unicum in Hungary , for example .
I &apos;ll give you one example .
The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior . Okay ?
Yet we &apos;ve never created the opportunity for impulse saving .
Now , I &apos;ve got an example here from Canada .
Shreddies is supposed to be square .
Voiceover : New Diamond Shreddies cereal .
I would say it &apos;s a work of genius .
So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies .
Weren &apos;t they square ?
They -- Yeah , it &apos;s all in the appearance .
But a six is very different from a nine .
Just try both of them .
Take a square one there , first .
The first one ?
Rory Sutherland : Now , naturally , a debate raged .
Two quotations to more or less end with .
Because they help people share news .
They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities .
Thank you very much indeed .
Diane Benscoter : How cults rewire the brain
That &apos;s me with the funny gloves .
They were called deprogrammers .
And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed .
And I then became a deprogrammer .
I started going out on cases .
Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary .
And about 20 years went by .
And that was , &quot; How did this happen to me ? &quot;
Because something did .
It was on Jonestown .
And it had a chilling effect on me .
These are the dead in Jonestown .
Their mates were chosen for them .
This is the leg of a suicide bomber .
I understand how this could happen .
And so what is this ? How does this work ?
I was really idealistic .
What happens is that circular logic takes over .
&quot; Moon is one with God .
God is going to fix all the problems in the world .
All I have to do is humbly follow .
It becomes impenetrable .
We &apos;re beginning to look inside the brain .
Thank you very much .
Ramona Pierson : An unexpected place of healing
She ended up underneath the car .
I ended up with blunt chest trauma .
Your aorta comes up behind your heart .
18 months later I woke up .
I was 64 lbs .
And in fact , they started to call me a Gomer .
Some things worked , some things didn &apos;t .
But eventually I started to look human again .
I had more than 50 surgeries .
But who &apos;s counting ?
I was bald .
I was wearing hospital scrubs .
And somebody donated tennis shoes for me .
So I had to go through trying to eat again .
And they went through that process .
She is sleeping in the corner of this apartment . &quot;
And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover .
But I did say no to the blue hair .
You learn things unconsciously .
But the men had a better idea .
They were going to make it fun for me .
So I moved on from there .
The redundancy was actually good for me .
So we &apos;ll just keep moving on .
So close your eyes .
Now imagine you have to cross a street .
So there were two obstacles I had to get through .
One was post-traumatic stress disorder .
If it &apos;s hit , don &apos;t cross the street . &quot;
Made perfect sense .
10 years later I gained my sight back .
Not magically .
It was actually robotic surgery .
So I was walking around it .
And I go , &quot; I &apos;m just going to touch it . &quot;
Thank you so much .
Asher Hasan : My message of peace from Pakistan
Namaste . Salaam .
Shalom . Sat Sri Akal .
Greetings to all of you from Pakistan .
And Pakistan , in this particular vein , is very similar .
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan .
My name is Abdul Khan . I come from Peshawar .
My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim .
My name is Zamin .
Do you see me on the other side of this fence ?
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth ?
I have come from a place of intense darkness .
And that is why I want to illuminate the world .
My name is Papusay .
My heart and drum beat as one .
A rising tide lifts all boats .
Fantastic . Just stay up here .
That was fantastic .
I found that really moving .
It felt like it was really important .
They went through a lot to get here .
Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please ?
I just really wanted to acknowledge you .
Thank you so much .
Ben Dunlap : The life-long learner
But there it is : &quot; Yo napot , pacak ! &quot;
So , &quot; Yo napot , pacak ! &quot;
His name was Sandor Teszler .
He built one plant after another .
But Mr. Teszler answered , &quot; No , that will not be necessary .
And then resumed the beating .
&quot; No , I reckon I don &apos;t . &quot;
Do you have any other questions ? &quot;
&quot; Yo napot , Sandor ! &quot;
But they did , they did like each other .
&quot; Learn as if you &apos;ll live forever . &quot;
So I discovered some very interesting things .
And I &apos;m not comfortable with that .
They are visual , auditory , reading and writing and kinesthetic .
And I think that is incredible .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about your mindset .
&quot; We learned it in college . &quot;
And what is the definition then ? &quot; The definition ?
Everyone knows , &quot; they say .
But then you know , I press them like this .
And here you have the dataset .
And here , length of life , life expectancy , 30 , 40 , 50 .
And really this is about the bedroom .
And we had one set of countries up there which was the western world .
They had small families and long life .
And all the developing world started to apply family planning .
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here .
We have Liberia . We have Congo .
So we have countries living there .
Look here when I move them forward .
Here we go .
They catch up . There &apos;s Mexico .
It &apos;s on par with United States in these two social dimensions .
Income per person . I can put that here .
And we will then see a completely different picture .
I can go back 200 years in history .
And I can find United States up there .
And I can let the other countries be shown .
And now I have income per person on this axis .
Here we come . And that was the influenza .
It &apos;s still remembered . The fall of life expectancy .
Did you note there , that we have Mexico up there ?
But this was 1963 .
It &apos;s not really , really flat .
So , how could we make better sense about this ?
These people go to bed hungry .
And this is the number of people .
And this is how the world changed .
It changed like this .
And it goes over here ?
Probably the world will do this .
and then it will continue forward like this .
We have all this at the same time .
And on this axis , GDP .
Now all your different departments .
East Europe , Latin America , and OECD countries .
And here were are . We have a continuum in the world .
We cannot put it into two parts .
It &apos;s Lincoln here , advancing them .
It &apos;s Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries .
And then it &apos;s United States today , up here .
At this point I decided to make a pause .
Many are not aware of -- no , this is not a joke .
This is very serious .
And they are highly skilled professionals .
And I &apos;m not paid to come here , no .
Look here . This is the world .
With income down there and child mortality .
And what has happened in the world ?
And we had an increase in income .
And how fast has this happened ?
Let &apos;s see what Sweden has done .
We used to boast about fast social progress .
That &apos;s where we were , 1900 .
1900 , Sweden was there .
They started very well . They used the aid well .
I run Sweden the same 16 year period .
5.5 percent . They are faster than the millennium development goal .
Well the Swedish students protest at this point .
We have to do real-time competition . &quot;
Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden .
And here we go . It took a little time for them to get independent .
But then they started to grow their economy .
And they made the social investment . They got away malaria .
These yellow are just about to be doing this .
Not simplistic extrapolation .
And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world .
The blue is Africa .
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected .
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa .
They have a very high level . It &apos;s coming down .
Because here , in Congo , there is war .
And here , in Zambia , there is peace .
And it &apos;s really different within each country .
Look at the provinces of Kenya . They are very different .
And this is the situation you see .
It &apos;s similar to other nutritional diseases .
It will never affect a rich person .
We have seen it here in Mozambique .
You never heard about the disease .
Cause crippling throughout the world .
There is still mystery in one billion .
They are still as poor as they &apos;ve ever been .
It &apos;s the World Department .
Jarreth Merz : Filming democracy in Ghana
I was free , I was happy .
It was a dimly lit shack .
Now this was being broadcast live .
I wanted to blend in like a chameleon .
I think it was a tactic of survival .
And it worked , or so I believed .
And I felt I was being typecast as an actor .
I was always playing the exotic African .
The rhetoric of the candidates , of course , changed .
The heat was on .
And then the cliche came to haunt us .
We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets .
People were being beaten brutally .
The army started firing their guns . People were scrambling .
It was complete chaos .
They were chanting , &quot; We want peace .
We want peace . &quot;
After all , they decide , and they did .
The sounds of the voices were harmonious .
So it could happen .
A democracy could be upheld peacefully .
Now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
And guess what , it worked .
Thank you .
Johnny Lee : Free or cheap Wii Remote hacks
And they actually use the Nintendo Wii remote .
This is Adobe Photoshop .
Thank you .
So let &apos;s switch back to that .
Thank you .
So thank you very much .
I didn &apos;t come from a military family .
I &apos;m not a military brat .
I &apos;m going to send you to military school . &quot;
And it never worked .
And I kept on getting lost .
There really wasn &apos;t a whole lot going on .
I didn &apos;t ever feel like I was in danger .
That was the new reality .
I signed up because college was expensive .
They signed up because of a sense of obligation .
They signed up because they wanted some form of revenge .
They signed for a whole collection of different reasons .
I just said it because it sounded right .
&quot; Thank you for your service . &quot;
It keeps playing out in all of our minds .
It plays out in all of our memories .
It plays out in all of our emotions .
What was the experience like ? How are you doing ? &quot;
&quot; Thank you for your service , &quot; and we move on .
He loses his leg in Iraq .
She barely survives .
We signed up because we love this country we represent .
Can we simply print money for aid ?
&quot; Surely not . &quot;
It &apos;s a common reaction .
It &apos;s a quick talk .
Others channel John McEnroe .
&quot; You cannot be serious ! &quot;
On the left , we have Pia .
She lives in England .
Dorothy , on the right , lives in rural Kenya .
The U.N. agrees too .
History suggests not .
There &apos;s also been some success .
One in eight remain hungry .
So what can be done ?
The money wasn &apos;t actually physically printed .
But the amount created was unprecedented .
Three times !
They bought fixed income securities , bonds .
They bought equities too .
That confidence was based on two pillars .
It was the same elsewhere .
Brilliant .
Let &apos;s call this scheme &quot; Print Aid . &quot;
And here &apos;s how it might work .
So far so good .
How risky is this ?
It sounds more inflationary already , doesn &apos;t it .
Are you read for this ?
There was no inflation .
Would the risks really be that different ?
To me , it &apos;s not that clear .
What is clear is the impact on aid .
Now , we don &apos;t get to 0.7 percent .
Governments are still incentivized to give .
We might be able to feed the front row .
That may not always be the case .
That may not always be the case .
I seriously believe the question should be , why not ?
Thank you very much .
But it &apos;s very simple . It &apos;s very simplistic .
Now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment .
Life also has a kind of inheritable information .
We use this idea called self-assembly .
So that &apos;s just forming some body stuff , right ?
Some architectures .
We started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite .
It forms a surface that is , say , chemically active .
It could run a metabolism on it .
Some things are missing .
You add the droplet to the system .
So I add some food source to the system .
The protocell moves . It encounters the food .
We &apos;re going to make two different kinds .
There &apos;s a protocell AB now in this system .
Just with blobs of chemicals , again .
Think of it like a primordial ooze , okay ?
But they have lifelike properties , is the point .
This is a term by Steve Benner .
Cameron Sinclair : My wish : A call for open-source architecture
I &apos;m going to take you on a journey very quickly .
That led to 550 entries from 53 countries .
2004 was the tipping point for us .
So this is a brief overview .
All problems are local . All solutions are local .
OK , because I &apos;m going to do it very quick .
I &apos;m adding that to my time .
So here &apos;s a select number of projects .
Using straw bale construction , creating heat walls .
We went to Africa , originally to look at the housing issue .
And we started engaging the medical community .
We just don &apos;t know how to show this . &quot;
So you know , this is a serious solution .
Every one of these projects is sustainable .
That &apos;s not because I &apos;m a tree-hugging green person .
You have to know where your energy is coming from .
You have to know where your resource is coming from .
And you have to keep the maintenance down .
This is our home ground .
I can see Chris looking at me slyly .
So when you come to TEDGlobal , you can check it out .
Here is another school .
It &apos;s built by the parents of the kids .
The kids are out there on-site , building the buildings .
So , disaster hits home .
This is a rehabbed home , done in four days .
She &apos;s 70 years old . This is what FEMA gave her .
600 bucks , happened two days ago .
We put together very quickly a washroom .
That was their home , and these are the photographs they took .
This is the new U.N. tent , just introduced this year .
Quick to assemble . It &apos;s got a flap , that &apos;s the invention .
I was 12 years old . There &apos;s a problem here .
Luckily , we &apos;re not alone .
I &apos;m not sure what they &apos;re smoking .
So this is all done in the last two years .
Chris Luebkeman will tell you why .
What I see is many , many inventors .
One billion people live in abject poverty .
We hear about them all the time .
How do we improve the living standards of five billion people ?
With 10 million solutions .
Wait a second . Wait a second . That &apos;s your wish ?
CS : That &apos;s my wish .
That &apos;s his wish !
So why not this many people ?
Open-source architecture is the way to go .
Secondly , what will this thing be ?
So doing that globally .
And I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually .
Just leave it up there for a sec .
CS : Well , what will it take ? You guys are smart .
I &apos;m fed up of talking about making change .
You only make it by doing it .
We &apos;ve changed international response -- based on building things .
Thank you .
David Bolinsky : Visualizing the wonder of a living cell
They power our minds .
Run the movie , please .
They pass information to each other .
They cause different things to happen inside the cell .
This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell .
Enjoy the rest of the show . Thank you .
Nature . Beauty . Gratitude .
So I started shooting time-lapse photography .
It also provides a third of the food we eat .
It &apos;s given to you . It &apos;s a gift .
Look at the sky .
We so rarely look at the sky .
We just think of good weather and bad weather .
Open your eyes . Look at that .
Look at the faces of people whom you meet .
You flip a switch and there is electric light .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Eddy Cartaya : My glacier cave discoveries
Okay , a few of you .
So what is a glacier ?
This cave was amazing .
There &apos;s our camp on the left side of this entrance room .
But there are some really cool things in there .
Thank you very much .
Who studied some physics in university ?
Okay , lots of you .
So , physics and marketing .
Getting a little more technical now .
By measuring it , the act of measurement changes it .
The act of observation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in marketing .
Think about Toyota .
Well , you know the story .
The same is true of marketing .
But then you lose control of it .
Your brand starts being dispersed , it gets more chaotic .
It &apos;s out of your control .
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed .
You can &apos;t fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it .
Thank you .
The seeds are then planted , then grown .
This is what I found out .
Thank you .
And so for that , he &apos;s called crazy by the system .
Now I know definitely which one I would choose .
Thank you .
Brenda Laurel : Games for girls
Why is that ?
It can &apos;t just be a giant sexist conspiracy .
These people aren &apos;t that smart .
There &apos;s six billion dollars on the table .
So , what is the deal here ?
Then we formed a spin-off company .
Girl 1 : Yeah , my character is usually a tomboy .
Hers is more into boys .
Girl 2 : Uh , yeah .
Girl 2 : Divorced -- parents divorced , maybe .
Girl 3 : This is my pretend &#91; unclear &#93; one .
Girl 4 : We make a school newspaper on the computer .
But she gives my sister everything .
Let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
This is the second day in Rockett &apos;s life .
Miko : Hey Rockett ! C &apos;mere !
Rockett : Hi Miko ! What &apos;s going on ?
Miko : I don &apos;t think so .
Rockett : Really ? What other party ?
Girl : Max &apos;s party is going to be so cool , Whitney .
He &apos;s invited all the best people .
Rockett : Who &apos;d want to show up at that party anyway ?
OK , so we &apos;re going to emotionally navigate .
If we were playing the game , that &apos;s what we &apos;d do .
Oops , I turned the wrong way .
We love them .
We see them .
We &apos;re not trying to tell them who they ought to be .
It turns out they &apos;re really great .
&quot; Rockett 28 ! &quot;
Thanks .
It was like having an enormous new toy .
Just being out on the street was exhilarating .
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with .
For me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
You &apos;re all part of the artwork too .
Patrick Chappatte : The power of cartoons
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it -- newspapers ?
It &apos;s a sort of paper-based reader .
It &apos;s lighter than an iPad , it &apos;s a bit cheaper .
You know what they say ?
You &apos;ve read about it already .
Ladies and gentlemen , the world has gotten smaller .
And you know the reason why , of course .
This is because of technology -- yeah .
Any computer designers in the room ?
That makes a good cartoon .
That &apos;s true .
Don &apos;t go asking for a Frappuccino there .
So we are bridging the digital divide .
The Third World is connected , we are connected .
And what happens next ?
Well , you &apos;ve got mail .
Yeah .
Well , the Internet has empowered us .
No , but it &apos;s true : the Internet has changed the world .
But yeah , it has liberated us from the office desk .
This is your life , enjoy it .
They are shaping the way we consume .
They are shaping our very desires .
You will not like it .
Now I shouldn &apos;t get into this .
This was so sickening ; people died because of cartoons .
This is not how it works . &quot;
They wanted to stir up controversy .
You know the story .
We know that cartoons can be used as weapons .
And here we are now .
This got me thinking .
This looks like a giant hamburger .
So you see the style is different .
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning .
So this is really journalism in cartoons .
You &apos;ll hear more and more about it .
This is the future of journalism , I think .
And I went to see the Dozo .
The Dozo , they are the traditional hunters of West Africa .
They are believed to have magical powers .
They can disappear and escape bullets .
&quot; Another time . &quot;
And what can a cartoonist do ?
So the idea was pretty simple .
Show the positive power of cartoons .
And I &apos;m very proud of what they did .
And I didn &apos;t ask them to do nice cartoons .
The first day , they were even shouting at each other .
So the idea was there .
In Lebanon , it was not a book .
And it worked .
So this was a great project .
He has to keep his job .
And that &apos;s the message I try to convey to them .
Thank you .
Heather Brooke : My battle to expose government corruption
Once upon a time , the world was a big , dysfunctional family .
The children looked and were amazed .
They behaved just like the children .
And they made mistakes , too , just like the children .
And so she set about to make it so .
I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy .
Well , guess what ? I won . Hooray .
So , thank you .
It &apos;s the system which underpins all these other systems .
Well , it just can &apos;t . That &apos;s it .
This is Birgitta Jónsdóttir . She &apos;s an Icelandic MP .
They &apos;re not magic . They are not our parents .
Because that is what Julian Assange did .
You &apos;ve got to have skepticism and humility .
Skepticism , because you must always be challenging .
I want to see the evidence behind why that &apos;s so .
At the moment our rights are incredibly weak .
So that -- yes . Yes ! My power pose .
I would like us to work towards that .
He actually said that , it was a matter of life and death .
It was just , &quot; Because I say so .
You have to trust me . Take it on faith . &quot;
You &apos;ve got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance .
They &apos;ve kidded out the house with CCTV cameras .
Well , is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare ?
Some fairy tales have happy endings . Some don &apos;t .
Thank you .
They &apos;re far more efficient in terms of energy .
They hardly ever make mistakes .
And they can repair themselves for longevity .
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot .
So this is a NAND gate .
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed .
If you have errors , you can replace a part .
So basically you have a chain of elements .
Each element is completely identical , and they &apos;re biased .
So what does this tell us about the future ?
There &apos;s new programmability in these parts .
And from that you have new possibilities for computing .
We &apos;ll have spatial computing .
So it &apos;s exciting potential for this .
Thank you .
Most people do pick the paper .
Okay , let &apos;s think of why .
It &apos;s brown to start with .
Therefore , it must be good for the environment .
It &apos;s biodegradable . It &apos;s reusable .
In some cases , it &apos;s recyclable .
And I work in design .
And that &apos;s where this process called life cycle thinking comes in .
And we &apos;ve busted a bunch of myths .
Allow me to explain .
Landfill is a different environment .
It &apos;s got no oxygen . It &apos;s tightly compacted and hot .
I &apos;m a product designer by trade .
I then did social science .
Now America has this amazing ability to keep growing refrigerators .
And as I was just explaining , food waste is a problem .
I mean , there &apos;s a lot of complex systems going on here .
I don &apos;t want to make it so simplistic .
Yeah ? Soggy lettuces ?
It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report .
Okay . You need a tight environment .
Anyway , I &apos;m clearly obsessed .
But essentially , this is a big problem .
We &apos;ve had to clear land .
We &apos;ve had to plant seeds , phosphorus , fertilizers , nutrients , water , sunlight .
Forty percent food waste is a major problem .
So they &apos;re very popular .
How do I make the materials green in the manufacturing ? &quot;
Would you ask me those questions ?
They seem logical , right ? Yeah .
Well I &apos;d say , &quot; You &apos;re looking at the wrong problems . &quot;
Because the problem is with use .
But this is the thing .
And this guy over here , though , he does . He &apos;s named Simon .
Simon works for the national electricity company in the U.K.
He &apos;s also watching television .
1.5 million kettles , seriously problematic .
There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions as of last year .
They have so much locked up inside them .
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked .
They burn the electronic waste in open spaces .
These are communities , and this is happening all over the world .
These kinds of products are everywhere .
Benoit Mandelbrot : Fractals and the art of roughness
Thank you very much .
There are many different kinds of mess .
But it is not so .
So let me show you a few objects .
Some of them are artificial .
Others of them are very real , in a certain sense .
Well , it &apos;s very interesting .
Now , what did humanity do with that ?
Very , very little .
I said , &quot; Well , just short of 1.5 . &quot;
It was 1.48 .
Now , it didn &apos;t take me any time .
I &apos;ve been looking at these things for so long .
I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial .
To the right , I took a higher roughness .
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness .
Very few things are very smooth .
Well , you measure and measure and measure .
What &apos;s the length of the coastline of these lakes ?
You must do it differently .
What good is that , to know these things ?
Well , surprisingly enough , it &apos;s good in many ways .
We see mountains in the distance .
They may be mountains , but they may be just formulae , just cranked on .
Now it &apos;s very easy to do .
Now look at that . That &apos;s a real lung .
Now a lung is something very strange .
Enormous disagreements .
Now , what good is it to have that ?
You have formulas that long .
And you crank it several times .
Sometimes repeatedly : again , again , again , the same repetition .
And at the end , you get things like that .
This cloud is completely , 100 percent artificial .
Well , 99.9 .
Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds .
The seer of clouds had to take account of it .
Now , here is another thing which is rather interesting .
Well , they do mix .
And well , it &apos;s a story unto itself .
Well actually , I was not silly .
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well .
The things on the ground are algae .
But painting for a long time had a fractal side .
I could speak of that for a long time .
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect .
This is a mess , mess , mess , Brownian loop .
I see ; it &apos;s an island . &quot;
And amazing .
I measured it , 1.33 .
Again , again , again .
Long measurements , big Brownian motions , 1.33 .
Mathematical problem : how to prove it ?
It took my friends 20 years .
They got together , and together they had the proof .
To the left you see data over a long period .
There are thousands of books on that .
Now compare that with real price increments .
Where are real price increments ?
But I tell you , at this point , people listened to me .
&quot; Well , acts of God .
In other words , it is not acts of God that we should put aside .
That is the meat , the problem .
Well , here are the curves for it .
In a way , it &apos;s the story of my life .
And after the war , I saw an uncle again .
Very simple .
This shape is of an extraordinary complication .
It &apos;s so simple , so dry .
It &apos;s so uninteresting .
I mean this comes out .
I don &apos;t want to explain these things .
This comes out . This comes out .
This comes out repeatedly , again , again , again .
And then this one .
The color was added for two reasons .
It &apos;s so complicated .
In 1990 , I was in Cambridge , U.K.
So where did this come from ?
Obviously , from extraterrestrials .
Well , let me finish .
Thank you very much .
Sebastian Junger : Why veterans miss war
That &apos;s a sane response to war .
That &apos;s what &apos;s so complicated about war .
That &apos;s the thing that has to be understood .
It was six miles long .
It was very intense .
I spent most of my time up there .
There was no running water .
There was no way to bathe .
The guys were up there for a month at a time .
They never even got out of their clothes .
They fought . The worked .
They slept in the same clothes .
They burned them and got a new set .
There was no Internet . There was no phone .
There was no communication with the outside world up there .
There was no cooked food .
Combat they did learn to like .
It was incredibly hot .
First of all , the experience is very bizarre , it &apos;s a very bizarre one .
It &apos;s not what I had expected .
Usually , you &apos;re not scared .
Time slows down .
You get this weird tunnel vision .
It &apos;s almost a slightly altered state of mind .
It &apos;s wired into us .
It &apos;s hormonally supported .
Something hit the side of my face , and I didn &apos;t know what it was .
So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face .
Half a second later , I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh .
It was machine gun fire .
Just think about the math on that .
The boys are up there for a year .
They got back .
Some of them stayed in the Army and were more or less okay , psychologically .
I &apos;m still very good friends with him .
He came back to the States . He got out of the Army .
I had a dinner party one night .
&quot; Ma &apos;am , I miss almost all of it . &quot;
What is he talking about ?
He &apos;s not a psychopath .
He doesn &apos;t miss killing people .
If we &apos;re going to stop war , we have to answer that question .
I think what he missed is brotherhood .
Now , brotherhood is different from friendship .
Friendship happens in society , obviously .
It didn &apos;t bother him .
They thought he was dead .
It was in the middle of a huge firefight .
The bullet had just knocked him out .
It glanced off the helmet .
And he was thinking , &quot; I &apos;m not dead . &quot;
And he sat up .
That &apos;s brotherhood .
This wasn &apos;t invented recently .
Many of you have probably read &quot; The Iliad . &quot;
That is terrifying .
Thank you very much .
The first problem is there &apos;s inadequate disaster response .
We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Earlier this year , in March , Clay took his own life .
And perhaps most tragically , he lost his self-worth .
He joins the Army . The Army gives him a rifle .
They send him to Iraq .
Every day he leaves the wire with a mission .
It &apos;s to keep the men around him alive .
It &apos;s to pacify the village that he works in .
They &apos;ve eaten together . They &apos;ve bled together .
He goes home to Kansas City , Missouri .
He gets out of the military . He takes his uniform off .
He doesn &apos;t have that community anymore .
He joins the Army . The Army gives him a rifle .
They send him to Iraq .
He doesn &apos;t have that same self-worth .
Thank you very much .
Life was good .
And then everything went black .
My body was consumed by pain .
I &apos;d broken my neck and my back in six places .
I broke five ribs on my left side .
I broke my right arm . I broke my collarbone .
I broke some bones in my feet .
My whole right side was ripped open , filled with gravel .
I had head injures . I had internal injuries .
I was having a really bad day .
For over 10 days , I drifted between two dimensions .
&quot; No . It &apos;s too hard . &quot;
&quot; Come on . This is our opportunity . &quot;
I was at a crossroads .
It was the fight of my life .
They &apos;d have to operate .
The central nervous system nerves , there is no cure .
You &apos;ll have internal injuries for the rest of your life .
You &apos;ll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life .
I tried to grasp what she was saying .
After six months , it was time to go home .
I felt so incredibly grateful for my life .
In the spinal ward , that &apos;s normal .
You &apos;re in a wheelchair . That &apos;s normal .
I realized Sister Sam was right .
I did get depressed .
And I wanted to give up .
Gone . &quot;
And that realization was about to change my life .
If I can &apos;t walk , then I might as well fly . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s nice , dear . &quot;
Is that a problem ? &quot;
I &apos;m holding on to the counter because I can &apos;t stand .
I said , &quot; Hi , I &apos;m here for a flying lesson . &quot;
Andrew the instructor got in the front , started the airplane up .
He went , &quot; Oh . &quot;
So he got over to the runway , and he applied the power .
And I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And I took the controls , and I was flying .
And sometimes I thought that too .
And then I got my commercial pilot &apos;s license .
And then I got my instructor rating .
And then I thought , &quot; Why stop there ?
Why not learn to fly upside down ? &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hans Rosling : The best stats you &apos;ve ever seen
This country over here is China . This is India .
This is India . Indonesia &apos;s moving on pretty fast .
One dollar , 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day .
In Sierra Leone , humanitarian aid .
But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka .
But I would like to bring you back to about here at 1960 .
You have to train health staff . You have to educate the population .
And Sheikh Sayed did that in a fairly good way .
Because the data is hidden down in the databases .
The publicly-funded data is down here .
And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net .
He only says , &quot; We can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And that &apos;s a quite clever guy , huh ?
This is the income distribution of China , 1970 .
the income distribution of the United States , 1970 .
Almost like a ghost , isn &apos;t it , huh ?
Paddy Ashdown : The global power shift
But for us , I want to talk about three factors today .
It &apos;s also moving vertically .
Now notice , I &apos;m not talking about government .
The world needs an international forum .
And watch that beginning to happen .
But that &apos;s a subject of a different discussion .
You see India , you see Brazil .
Britain always played to the balance .
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances .
But that &apos;s no longer true .
Now we have to call in others .
Now we have to create the G20 .
Oh yes ? Why not ?
3,700 .
How many Americans ? 11 .
The Chinese naval contingent .
Of course they are , they are a mercantilist nation .
They want to keep the sea lanes open .
And here &apos;s the third factor , which is totally different .
We are now interdependent .
The interrelationship of nations , well it &apos;s always existed .
But now we are intimately locked together .
Lehman Brothers goes down , the whole lot collapses .
We are all now deeply , deeply , deeply interconnected .
That was when the enemy was outside the walls .
Now the enemy is inside the walls .
And this tells you something very important .
So here is Ashdown &apos;s third law .
You understand that in industry ; governments don &apos;t .
But now one final thing .
It is no longer the case .
Collective security is not enough .
They shared a destiny with their enemies .
The great poem of John Donne &apos;s .
&quot; Send not for whom the bell tolls . &quot;
The poem is called &quot; No Man is an Island . &quot;
For John Donne , a recommendation of morality .
Thank you very much .
Stewart Brand : What squatter cities can teach us
Basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
The question is , why ?
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
They &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
Education is the main event that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
And here &apos;s the second punch line .
That &apos;s the news from downtown . Here it is in perspective .
Now we &apos;re shining right back up .
Thank you .
Mark Ronson : How sampling transformed music
So what I &apos;m going to do is play this .
Ken Robinson : Good morning . How are you ?
I &apos;m going to do so in a way that tells a story .
Tod Machover : Something nobody &apos;s ever heard before .
I have a crossfader .
Julian Treasure : I call this the mixer .
Two D.J. decks .
You turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
Dan Ellsey : I have always loved music .
And the 21st century .
KR : Turn on the radio . Pop into the discotheque .
Mark Ronson : This is my favorite part .
You gotta have doorstops . That &apos;s important .
TM : We all love music a great deal .
Ryan Holladay : Blend seamlessly .
Yay !
They seem like a nice person .
You &apos;d certainly learn a lot .
That &apos;s the major thread .
I &apos;d like to play a song for you .
It &apos;s been sampled 547 times .
I do hope that comes back soon .
Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box .
That was 1984 .
It &apos;s Throwback Thursday already .
I was in the middle .
I didn &apos;t care who liked it .
It &apos;s thoroughly modern Biggie .
And so , it &apos;s a groaner .
You can &apos;t just hijack nostalgia wholesale .
It leaves the listener feeling sickly .
It runs a risk of being completely bland .
We live in the post-sampling era .
That &apos;s just how it goes .
So I hope you enjoy this . Here we go .
Let &apos;s hear that TED sound again , right ?
Thank you very much . Thank you .
And that &apos;s changed irrevocably .
So I wrote a letter .
It was a 7.6 magnitude . It was fairly big .
More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook .
They were well respected . They were known .
Let &apos;s see who they are . &quot;
Getting real windy in just a second .
Oh , shit !
This is from Hama .
Three different sources said three different things about the bridge .
They said , one , the bridge doesn &apos;t exist .
So that was the only one that gave us a clue .
We looked through the video for other clues .
We saw the distinctive railings , which we could use .
It had black-and-white curbs .
Truth is never binary . Truth is a value .
Thanks very much .
Thandie Newton : Embracing otherness , embracing myself
Embracing otherness .
It &apos;s no longer valid or real .
Is it who we really are ?
The self was not constant .
And it is important .
It has an extremely important function .
But my skin color wasn &apos;t right .
My hair wasn &apos;t right .
My history wasn &apos;t right .
I was a noticeable nobody .
I &apos;d literally lose myself .
And I was a really good dancer .
I applied to read anthropology at university .
&quot; So biology , genetics ? &quot; she said .
&quot; Because , Thandie , that &apos;s not accurate .
On the one hand , result .
Right ?
My desire to disappear was still very powerful .
And of course I did .
I give it its due .
I take it to therapy .
I &apos;ve become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior .
But I &apos;m not ashamed of my self .
Let &apos;s not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness .
It &apos;s more a reality than the ones our selves have created .
Simple awareness is where it begins .
Thank you for listening .
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie : The danger of a single story
I &apos;m a storyteller .
I had never been outside Nigeria .
But that is another story .
I come from a conventional , middle-class Nigerian family .
My father was a professor .
My mother was an administrator .
His name was Fide .
So I felt enormous pity for Fide &apos;s family .
I was startled .
I was 19 .
She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove .
Now , I &apos;ve laughed every time I &apos;ve read this .
My characters drove cars .
They were not starving .
I remember first feeling slight surprise .
And then I was overwhelmed with shame .
I did not have a single story of America .
All of these stories make me who I am .
They make one story become the only story .
I was not only charmed , I was very moved .
Stories matter .
Many stories matter .
Thank you .
Don Levy : A cinematic journey through visual effects
I hope you will enjoy .
Jake : Hey guys .
Oh , you &apos;re wiggling your toes .
Maharaja : Nothing to worry about , not a thing .
Find me when you can . &quot;
Thank you .
Imogen Heap : &quot; Wait It Out &quot;
Hadyn Parry : Re-engineering mosquitos to fight disease
But of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito .
And that &apos;s not really the case .
And dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally .
Now let &apos;s assume you go on holiday .
Well , you could develop flu-like symptoms .
They could be quite mild .
And that &apos;s the nickname given to this disease .
So why is it spreading so fast ?
And the answer is this thing .
This is Aedes aegypti .
That &apos;s two days ago .
So we must be good at killing mosquitos .
I mean , that can &apos;t be very difficult .
Well , there &apos;s two principle ways .
The first way is that you use larvicides .
It &apos;s just not practical .
This is a picture of fogging .
You could do the same with a space spray .
Clearly the product you &apos;ve got has got to be safe to humans .
We are going to use it in and around humans .
It has to be safe .
This one &apos;s not . It &apos;s invaded you .
You just want to get this one .
It &apos;s only the female mosquito that will actually bite you .
It &apos;s just the female .
So basically , we &apos;ve used those two factors .
They only live a few days .
And that &apos;s exactly where we are .
And what &apos;s the result ?
Well , the result has been very good .
We can transport them around the world .
So we &apos;ve got that . You could call it a mosquito factory .
There you are . We &apos;ve sent mosquito eggs .
We &apos;ve separated the males from the females .
It &apos;s actually a little bit more precise than that .
We &apos;ve also done this in agriculture .
And I &apos;m in favor , actually . Of course I am .
So for the mosquito , it &apos;s a dead end .
Thank you very much .
Gero Miesenboeck : Re-engineering the brain
I have a doppelganger .
I control the brain in order to understand how it works .
But think for a moment what that means .
There &apos;s 10,000 neurons here .
We don &apos;t understand the code used by the brain .
But how ?
We need to rearrange the pattern .
But we &apos;ll certainly learn a lot .
Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude .
But these pores here are special .
She cut the heads off of her flies .
They didn &apos;t get very far , obviously .
Here &apos;s some such CCTV footage .
And the logic of our experiment was simple .
Its behavior is completely unchanged .
But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different .
This is one piece of good news .
Thank you .
Ramsey Musallam : 3 rules to spark learning
I teach chemistry .
All right , all right .
Some people nodding yes .
The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating .
Rule number one : Curiosity comes first .
Rule number two : Embrace the mess .
We &apos;re all teachers . We know learning is ugly .
And rule number three : Practice reflection .
Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms ?
Our students our worth it .
And each case is different .
All right . Sorry .
So these are my daughters .
On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family .
And , on the left , Riley .
Yeah . Why .
We all were at that age .
How will they grow this curiosity ?
Thank you very much .
Magnus Larsson : Turning dunes into architecture
Now , as architects we &apos;re trained to solve problems .
The threat is desertification .
It is simple and complex .
It is peaceful and violent .
That &apos;s a cyclical process .
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel .
The name means &quot; edge of the desert . &quot;
And it &apos;s one that gets very little attention .
So , we get climate change .
But , how far away is it ?
This is where the village used to be .
Now , sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts .
Trees or cacti are good for this .
Inside of the dunes we find shade .
How do we glue those grains of sand together ?
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours .
So , how much would this cost ?
How do we construct something like this ?
Well , I &apos;ll quickly show you two options .
The second alternative would be to use injection piles .
But , what should they look like ?
That &apos;s not true at all .
Sand-stopping devices , made from sand .
And quite frankly , we &apos;re putting our heads in the sand .
But , it &apos;s a beginning , it &apos;s a vision .
As Borges would have it , it &apos;s the sand .
This is a river .
This is a stream .
This is a river .
This is happening all over the country .
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well .
This is Prickly Pear Creek .
How did we get here ?
These senior water rights are key .
So they have no incentive to conserve .
It &apos;s a broken system .
Okay . Now I &apos;m going to change gears here .
I mean , there &apos;s water in beer .
Remember Prickly Pear .
Remember Prickly Pear .
It &apos;s a broken system .
But they have no incentive to do so .
We pay them to leave their water in-stream .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening here .
Okay ?
They connect people rather than dividing them .
And most importantly , it &apos;s working .
Thank you very much .
Robert Lang : The math and magic of origami
It ties to origami . So let me start .
What is origami ?
And that is what origami used to be .
But it &apos;s become something else .
It &apos;s become an art form , a form of sculpture .
It shows these women playing with these toys .
And that might have been the case .
And where it has led in origami is to things like this .
Naturalism . Detail .
And that leads to a very powerful tool .
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami .
Origami revolves around crease patterns .
And you can &apos;t just draw them arbitrarily .
They have to obey four simple laws .
And they &apos;re very simple , easy to understand .
Nothing else .
All of origami comes from that .
And I can put it in this simple equation .
And you might say , &quot; Can you really be that specific ?
And yeah , you really can .
So let me stretch out that equation .
I start with my idea . I abstract it .
What &apos;s the most abstract form ? It &apos;s a stick figure .
Now the first step , pretty easy .
Take an idea , draw a stick figure .
But we &apos;re going to start small .
This base has a lot of flaps in it .
We &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap .
How would you make a single flap ?
What paper went into that flap ?
I can use it for something else .
There are other dimensions for flaps .
There &apos;s other ways of making flaps .
So now we &apos;re ready to scale up .
What do I need ? I need a lot of circles .
And it &apos;s so simple .
It &apos;s so simple that a computer could do it .
And you say , &quot; Well , you know , how simple is that ? &quot;
Or you could do a moose .
Or , really , any other kind of deer .
These techniques revolutionized this art .
She &apos;s eating him .
I call it &quot; Snack Time . &quot;
And you can do more than just insects .
This tree frog has toes .
You can make multiple subjects .
So these are a couple of instrumentalists .
Do a little more complicated instrument . &quot;
Well , then you could do an organ .
But I want to show you some examples .
And I want to show you some of these examples .
The telescope , going up in space , it unfolds in two places .
They certainly didn &apos;t need to talk to origami artists .
They called it the Eyeglass .
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller ?
So you have to do something like this .
This was a small model .
Now , there is other origami in space .
And this example is the latter .
And they want to do their design by simulation .
And so they can do a simulation like this .
And that leads to a really interesting idea .
You know , where did these things come from ?
Thanks .
Barry Schwartz : Using our practical wisdom
That &apos;s Ken Sharpe over there .
Our kids &apos; teachers seem to be failing them .
They almost brought the entire financial system down .
They don &apos;t understand us .
They don &apos;t have the time to get to know us .
Rules and incentives -- &quot; sticks &quot; and &quot; carrots . &quot;
We &apos;ll see .
We need character .
We need people who want to do the right thing .
So what do they do ?
They fashion a novel solution to the problem .
Wise people know how to improvise .
A wise person knows when to improvise .
It &apos;s the case of Michael .
Michael &apos;s a young guy .
He had a pretty low-wage job .
Then he lost his job .
He panicked about being able to support his family .
He robbed him at gunpoint .
It was a toy gun .
He got caught . He got tried .
He got convicted .
He had never committed a crime before .
He had been faced with desperate circumstances .
All this would do is wreck a family .
Spend your night in jail , spend your day holding down a job .
He did . He served out his sentence .
He made restitution and found himself a new job .
And the family was united .
He won the appeal .
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison .
Judge Forer had to follow the law .
And Michael disappeared .
Now consider Ms. Dewey .
Ms. Dewey &apos;s a teacher in a Texas elementary school .
It &apos;s like they were about to go play a football game .
You need to have incentives .
People have to make a living .
First , they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity .
And second , they demoralize the activity itself .
We think , Ken and I , that there are real sources of hope .
One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell .
So he started selling marijuana .
He was busted in a drug sweep .
But Judge Russell did have an alternative .
And that &apos;s because he was in a special court .
He was in a court called the Veterans &apos; Court .
Judge Russell created the Veterans &apos; Court .
Why has the idea spread ?
None . None .
The bank was profitable .
The bankers stayed with their loan recipients .
They serviced the loans .
They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments .
We &apos;ll see .
So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about .
People want to be allowed to be virtuous .
They want to have permission to do the right thing .
Thanks .
Brian Greene : Making sense of string theory
So where do we go ?
All of that could be described using Newton &apos;s work .
And that communicates the force of gravity .
Even the Earth warps space around it .
Now look at the Moon .
It really works . It describes the data .
And that is what got Kaluza thinking .
That raised a question : warps and curves in what ?
So Kaluza said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space .
Amazing -- it just popped out .
Now clearly , Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously .
This is a man who would risk his life on theory .
We don &apos;t seem to see them .
Let me show you that one visually .
It &apos;s very hard to see it , though , from far away .
And I hope you appreciate this .
It took so long to get these ants to do this .
So , let me just tell you how that goes .
Superstring theory -- what is it ?
The idea is like this .
That is where conventional ideas stop .
Here is the new idea of string theory .
This something else is this dancing filament of energy .
They don &apos;t produce different musical notes .
Now here is the catch .
Now , does string theory offer an answer ?
Not yet .
This is a deep question .
So can we explain those 20 numbers ?
Let me show you how .
They have a very rich , intertwined geometry .
So let me bring some strings into the story .
How would we know it ?
Let me show you that idea visually .
But here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
Amazing possibility .
Thank you very much .
AJ Jacobs : My year of living biblically
And I like to immerse myself in my topics .
So , they answered my emails .
They answered my phone .
It was a wonderful experience .
So , I decided I would try this for a month .
This was the worst month of my life .
I do not recommend this at all .
So , that was hard .
You can just Google it .
So , I wasted some time there .
And I undertook this for two reasons .
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all .
So , not very .
But I &apos;ve become increasingly interested in religion .
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles .
I had Christian bibles .
I had Jewish bibles .
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules .
So I wanted to follow those .
So , certainly the challenge was there .
You only know if you try it .
So , I wanted to follow that rule .
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging .
So , I was able to stone one adulterer .
And I said , &quot; Well , that would be great ! &quot;
How should we view the Bible ?
How was the Bible written ?
And it &apos;s sort of evolved .
This became very , very clear , early on .
Well , that &apos;s another . I did spend some time shepherding .
So , you know , I met with creationists .
I went to the creationists &apos; museum .
And these are the ultimate literalists .
And I will say , though , the museum is gorgeous .
They really did a fantastic job .
Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks .
It &apos;s a remarkable thing .
Third , that thou shall have reverence .
The Sabbath can be sacred .
Thou shall not stereotype .
I wanted it to be about religion in America .
Oh , thank you very much .
Thank you . Bless you , bless you .
So , this was very inspiring to me .
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo .
Also , thou shalt not disregard the irrational .
And I would say , &quot; But that &apos;s crazy . &quot;
And they would say , &quot; Well , what about you ?
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake .
And I failed miserably .
Because you can &apos;t .
The key is to pick and choose the right parts .
You &apos;re just picking and choosing . &quot;
And I thought I &apos;d end with just a couple more .
There &apos;s me reading the Bible .
That &apos;s how I hailed taxicabs .
Kate Stone : DJ decks made of ... paper
And I was also really interested in wireless as well .
I was not at all interested in what he was saying .
I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere .
And this farm was 120,000 acres .
doing a Ph.D. in physics .
It really is .
It &apos;s just you do it by changing an environment .
You change its environment , and the object will flow .
Why didn &apos;t you come here in the first place ? &quot;
That &apos;s always the case .
And it &apos;s pretty simple , really .
There &apos;s lots of different things we &apos;ve created .
This is one of them , because I love cake .
So for example , we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a regular newspaper .
And we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
Okay .
So this is the bit I &apos;m really scared of .
I &apos;ll just describe how this works .
And it has really good response time .
It &apos;s using Bluetooth 4 , so it &apos;s pretty instantaneous .
Okay . Thanks .
And there &apos;s a couple of other things .
Okay , and this is a D.J. turntable .
Oh , yes . I just love doing that .
So I have a crossfader , and I have the two decks .
So this is my niece , Charlotte .
Yay !
So that &apos;s pretty much what I do .
I just love bringing technology together , having a lot of fun , being creative .
But it &apos;s not about the technology .
So thank you very much .
Robert Hammond : Building a park in the sky
So they elevated it .
And then it was abandoned .
At the time , there was a lot of opposition .
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down .
And it turns out , we got those numbers wrong .
So far it &apos;s cost about 150 million .
That was enough . It really got the city behind it .
There &apos;s three sections .
We opened the fist section in 2009 .
It &apos;s this amphitheater right over 10th Ave .
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now .
And this has been designed by Renzo Piano .
And they &apos;re going to break ground in May .
And we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
This was just installed last month .
Thanks .
Misha Glenny : How global crime networks work
I refer to organized crime .
Now it &apos;s time for full disclosure .
Obviously there were characters like this .
Like this character . Remember these guys ?
That means your police force wasn &apos;t working .
The court system wasn &apos;t functioning properly .
We prefer to know them as the mafia .
And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start .
And where were they heading ?
It has zones of production , like Afghanistan and Columbia .
It has zones of distribution , like Mexico and the Balkans .
Take Mexico , for example .
But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo ?
Since 1998 , five million people have died there .
Now , cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap .
And the answer is six vessels .
It was the liberalization of international financial markets .
for the money launderers .
But at the heart of this , is the offshore banking network .
Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars .
Well I can tell you , it &apos;s quite a few of them .
Now , the recession .
Not surprising , the most opportunistic industry in the whole world .
And it has no rules to its regulatory system .
What they &apos;ve done is they &apos;ve shifted their operations .
And it &apos;s been terribly successful .
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle .
Or perhaps I should say , more accurately , Señor Pringle .
It &apos;s really not that difficult .
So , cybercrime , do watch out for it .
Which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance .
They affect our bank accounts .
They affect our communications , our pension funds .
They even affect the food that we eat and our governments .
Thank you very much .
Larry Burns : The future of cars
People love their automobiles .
They allow us to go where we want to when we want to .
Songs are written about cars .
He wrote about a car .
And 750 million people in the world today own a car .
And you say , boy , that &apos;s a lot .
But you know what ?
That &apos;s just 12 percent of the population .
We wanted something that was really affordable .
First was Autonomy .
And Sequel truly is a real car .
So let me talk about hydrogen first .
And it can come from biofuels .
And that &apos;s quite exciting .
Now that &apos;s a lot of money .
So we &apos;re pretty excited about the future of hydrogen .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re driving to for 2010 .
And we talked about swarm networks earlier .
We find that premise quite exciting .
And again , this is a pretty big march to take here .
Thank you very much .
.
Larry , Larry , wait , wait , wait , wait , Larry , wait , wait one sec .
Just -- I &apos;ve got so many questions I could ask you .
I just want to ask one .
Larry Burns : Yeah , we &apos;re absolutely serious .
And secondly , it &apos;s a fundamental business proposition .
Drew Berry : Animations of unseeable biology
Now molecules are really , really tiny .
And by tiny , I mean really .
One way around this is to draw pictures .
And this idea is actually nothing new .
And he transformed our understanding of the Moon .
So this is a transection through blood .
And those red molecules are hemoglobin .
What would it look like ?
This is DNA in its classic double helix form .
This was work from a number of years ago .
Thank you .
So again , we begin with DNA .
It &apos;s packaged up and bundled up .
This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome .
And we &apos;ll come back to chromosomes in a minute .
So we &apos;re not going to be able to do that today ?
No , I &apos;m being told , &quot; No . &quot;
The nuclear envelope breaks down .
And then the cell splits down the middle .
So again , here we are at that equator moment .
The chromosomes line up .
So this is a single chromosome .
And you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome .
One is bundled up into one sausage .
The other strand is bundled up into the other sausage .
They &apos;re called mircrotubules . That name &apos;s not important .
It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes .
It is a signal broadcasting system .
It &apos;s also an attention sensing system .
And it &apos;s walked away down the microtubules .
It &apos;s molecular clockwork .
And here are the dynein . They &apos;re carrying that broadcasting system .
Thank you .
Welcome to Thailand .
In my country , that was the case in 1974 .
Seven children per family -- tremendous growth at 3.3 percent .
There was just no future .
We needed to reduce the population growth rate .
So we said , &quot; Let &apos;s do it . &quot;
No , we decided to do a bit more .
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw .
And this picture was sent throughout the country .
It &apos;s been blessed . &quot;
That was their perception .
And then we went to teachers .
So we went to the teachers .
Like , &quot; Mother takes the pill every night .
Very good , mother . Move ahead .
Uncle buys a condom . Very good , uncle . Move ahead .
Uncle gets drunk , doesn &apos;t use condom . Come back , start again . &quot;
Again , education , class entertainment .
And the kids were doing it in school too .
If you &apos;re pregnant , take care of your pregnancy .
And that was run by them .
And after 35 / 36 years , it &apos;s still going on .
And this is on the Fourth of July .
Of course , it must be American cola .
You get two brands , Coke and Pepsi .
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog . &quot;
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic .
And what happened ?
And so that &apos;s the case of everyone joining in .
But unfortunately , the government was in denial , denial , denial .
So our work wasn &apos;t affected .
So I went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations .
And that &apos;s when we went onto the airwaves .
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that .
And he said , &quot; Mechai , could you come and join ? &quot;
So I said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
So they were happy with that .
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids .
And then we went down one more step .
And we said , &quot; Everyone needs to be involved . &quot;
So they all trained .
In taxis , you get condoms .
So , can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms ?
Imagine if they had condoms , giving out to all sorts of people .
And these were the condoms that we introduced .
One says , &quot; Weapon of mass protection . &quot;
But I have some to give out afterward .
And so you can see that condoms can do so many things .
Stop global warming ; use condoms .
And let the next Olympics save some lives .
Why just run around ?
And then what happened ?
After all this time , everybody joined in .
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand .
We all need to help .
Those are the things to be provided by the business community .
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise .
So , that was done .
It &apos;s not a free gift .
Access to credit must be a human right .
Otherwise they &apos;ll never get out of poverty .
They said , &quot; They should stop making shoes and clothes .
And then we have silk , Thai silk .
That &apos;s the difference .
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino .
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo .
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection .
And then , finally , that is our network .
And these are our Thai tulips .
Thank you very much indeed .
Krista Tippett : Reconnecting with compassion
We &apos;re here to celebrate compassion .
And the going is pretty rough right now .
Compassion is a worthy successor .
What are its kindred and component parts ?
What &apos;s in its universe of attendant virtues ?
Compassion is also curious .
Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity .
Well that &apos;s going to be a breeding ground for compassion .
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy .
And compassion does seek physicality .
I can &apos;t quite explain it , and he can &apos;t either .
Compassion also looks like this .
This is Jean Vanier .
And compassion can also have those qualities .
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale .
Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way .
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages .
Well , he was complicated .
Gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
So was Martin Luther King , Jr . So was Dorothy Day .
So was Mother Teresa .
So are we all .
Thank you .
David Carson : Design and discovery
With that , let &apos;s get the first slide up here .
I mean , how nice is that ?
So , here &apos;s the first door . You know , you get the message .
You know , it &apos;s pretty clear .
O.K. , which one would you park in front of ?
Same color , same message , same words .
He didn &apos;t overpower it like they have a tendency to do .
This is for a book by &quot; Metropolis . &quot;
This is from my second book .
And of course , that wasn &apos;t the case .
It &apos;s something everybody has .
So it tends to get discounted .
I like this for a couple of reasons .
&quot; Don &apos;t mistake legibility for communication . &quot;
And I think that &apos;s sometimes an overlooked area .
This is working with Marshall McLuhan .
And so this book is called &quot; Probes . &quot; It &apos;s another word for quotes .
So , this was the contents page originally .
I hate this stuff . It &apos;s hard to read .
I was , O.K. ; that &apos;s fine .
And I thought , you know , what were they thinking ?
So , this is a six-shot sequence .
They were wild-posted around New York City .
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious .
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts , a school in Florida .
This amazes me . This is a product I just found out .
I felt this was one of the more successful solutions .
I did some work for Microsoft a few years back .
It was a worldwide branding campaign .
They thought some people didn &apos;t like them .
And this is how the ad ran around the world .
Now , there &apos;s kind of two issues here .
This is some work from Ray Gun .
There &apos;s a lot of great writing in &quot; Ray Gun . &quot;
And People magazine , I thought , got probably the best shot .
It did not let up .
This says : &quot; One clean fits all . &quot; .
This was what they found on their car .
This is my desktop .
We are wrapping up .
I &apos;m just not sure this is improvement .
What &apos;s next ? What &apos;s next is going to be people .
This lady &apos;s advertising for her lost pit bull .
That &apos;s pretty high for most occupations .
Some of them did ; some of them didn &apos;t .
Why not experiment ? Why not have some fun ?
Why not put some of yourself into the work ?
And if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job .
And if you wouldn &apos;t , what the heck are you doing ?
Thank you very much .
Jaime Lerner : A song of the city
I hope you &apos;ll understand my English .
In the mornings it is terrible , and the afternoon is worst .
So , the other character is Otto , the automobile .
Freeways .
He &apos;s a very demanding person .
Curitiba , Rio : it &apos;s like two birds kissing themselves .
And every city has its own design .
And that &apos;s the structure of the city of Curitiba .
And this is an articulated bus , double-articulated .
And we are very close to my house .
And that &apos;s the evolution of the system .
It &apos;s not enough , a new materials .
It &apos;s not enough , new sources of energy .
I &apos;ll speak on this later on .
The subway was against , of course .
And after , the children teach their parents .
Seven zero .
So teach the children .
All of a sudden , the Soviet Union , they split .
So , in a city , you have to work fast .
And I think creativity , innovation is starting .
And we cannot have all the answers .
OK ?
Please , allow me just two minutes .
You &apos;re going to make the music and the rhythm .
Brené Brown : The power of vulnerability
And I was like , &quot; Why not magic pixie ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; Let me think about this for a second . &quot;
I tried to call deep on my courage .
And I thought , you know , I am a storyteller .
I &apos;m a qualitative researcher .
And maybe I &apos;m just a storyteller .
And so I said , &quot; You know what ?
And she went , &quot; Haha . There &apos;s no such thing . &quot;
And this is where my story starts .
That was my mantra .
So I was very excited about this .
I want to understand them .
This is what it &apos;s all about .
So I thought , you know what , I &apos;m going to start with connection .
And it turned out to be shame .
So I was ready , and I was really excited .
You know this .
And I kind of got a handle on it .
That &apos;s it .
They believe they &apos;re worthy .
What do these people have in common ?
And so here &apos;s what I found .
What they had in common was a sense of courage .
They just talked about it being necessary .
They thought this was fundamental .
I personally thought it was betrayal .
And it did .
Do you have any recommendations ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; What does that mean ? &quot;
Don &apos;t bring your measuring stick . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Okay . &quot;
So I found a therapist .
And she said , &quot; How are you ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m great . I &apos;m okay . &quot;
She said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
&quot; I just need some strategies . &quot;
Thank you .
So she goes like this .
And then I said , &quot; It &apos;s bad , right ? &quot;
&quot; It just is what it is . &quot;
And it took about a year .
For me , it was a yearlong street fight .
It was a slugfest .
Vulnerability pushed , I pushed back .
Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability ?
No .
So this is what I learned .
What makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot;
Because I wanted to know what &apos;s out there .
We live in a vulnerable world .
You can &apos;t say , here &apos;s the bad stuff .
I don &apos;t want to feel these .
I &apos;m going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin .
I don &apos;t want to feel these .
And I know that &apos;s knowing laughter .
God .
You cannot selectively numb .
And it becomes this dangerous cycle .
And it doesn &apos;t just have to be addiction .
I &apos;m right , you &apos;re wrong . Shut up .
That &apos;s it .
Just certain .
This is what politics looks like today .
There &apos;s no discourse anymore .
There &apos;s no conversation .
There &apos;s just blame .
A way to discharge pain and discomfort .
We perfect .
That &apos;s not our job .
That &apos;s our job .
We do that in our personal lives .
I would say to companies , this is not our first rodeo , people .
We &apos;ll fix it . &quot;
Can I believe in this this passionately ?
Can I be this fierce about this ? &quot;
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you .
Jinsop Lee : Design for all 5 senses
Here &apos;s my clock .
However , here &apos;s Chris &apos; clock .
In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
So here are some other results .
The first is for instant noodles .
You know .
Okay , next , clubbing .
These people I still do hang out with .
All right , and smoking .
That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
Here &apos;s Chris &apos; clock .
Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
We could call this &quot; the perfumator . &quot;
All right , next .
Oh , one last thing before I leave .
You guys ready ?
All right .
He was the most respected scientist in the field .
Not a trivial matter .
You don &apos;t see it in the newspaper every day .
You see apples that are red , yellow , and green and that &apos;s about it .
But there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans .
And I want to give you an example of that .
It &apos;s a bit of a personal example , in fact .
Imagine that . 7,100 apples with names .
They gave them their name .
The bad news is they &apos;re extinct .
This book was published in 1904 .
See , we used to have a lot of apples .
And then he has to go even further .
And there are a couple of answers to that question .
And for that reason , we ought to be saving it .
Is agriculture adapted to that ?
The tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons .
Here &apos;s South Africa . The same story .
We will watch children starve to death on TV .
It &apos;s two breeding cycles for maize .
We have two rolls of the dice to get this right .
Now , the good news is that we have conserved .
In Rwanda , in the Solomon Islands .
To Svalbard , in fact .
That &apos;s at 78 degrees north .
It &apos;s otherworldly , beautiful .
And this next picture shows it in context , in Svalbard .
And here &apos;s the front door of this facility .
Again , when you get to the back , you get into an area that &apos;s really my favorite place .
Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ...
in this place there .
There &apos;s 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now .
This is a backup system for world agriculture .
It &apos;s a backup system for all the seed banks . Storage is free .
It operates like a safety deposit box .
Agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth .
So , this is not something pretty and nice to do .
It is , I agree , a nice thing to do .
But it &apos;s a necessary thing to do .
And we need to support it financially .
So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms .
Thank you .
Amos Winter : The cheap all-terrain wheelchair
The road was too rough .
Ashok : You also encouraged me to work .
I rested for a day at home .
The next day I went to my shop .
Now everything is back to normal .
Stephen Friend : The hunt for &quot; unexpected genetic heroes &quot;
That moment changed my life .
the answer is not really .
One of them is it &apos;s early days .
We don &apos;t know how to read the sentences .
We don &apos;t know how to follow the narrative .
Maybe we should be studying those that are well .
They &apos;re not going to help us .
That &apos;s not what we &apos;re looking for .
What &apos;s your evidence that this could be feasible ? &quot;
I want to give you two examples .
The first comes from San Francisco .
They went on to get AIDS .
They didn &apos;t get AIDS .
Where are we going to look ?
Well , we could look locally . That makes sense .
And let &apos;s look at a million individuals .
They started saying , &quot; This is interesting .
I would be glad to join your effort .
I would be willing to participate . &quot;
And they didn &apos;t say , &quot; Where &apos;s the MTA ? &quot;
We asked Leif up in Finland .
Basically all we need is information .
I &apos;m willing to be re-contacted . &quot;
What are our genes ? &quot;
Thank you very much .
Lesley Hazleton : The doubt essential to faith
Writing biography is a strange thing to do .
Yet the question wouldn &apos;t let go of me .
Still , some boundaries are larger than others .
He did not run down shouting , &quot; Hallelujah ! &quot;
and &quot; Bless the Lord ! &quot;
He did not radiate light and joy .
Quite the contrary .
Fear was the only sane response , the only human response .
In effect , they are the infidels .
This isn &apos;t faith .
It &apos;s difficult and stubborn .
I &apos;m not convinced of this .
I can hardly say I believe it .
Because despair is self-fulfilling .
And I , for one , refuse to live that way .
Call this naive if you like .
I think not .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Motor racing is a funny old business .
And then the next year , we start again .
Now , the car you see in front of you is quite complicated .
So there &apos;s about 25,000 things there that can go wrong .
We &apos;re always trying to make it faster .
So how do we do that ?
Well , we start our life with the racing car .
It &apos;s measuring all sorts of things around the car .
It &apos;s a huge amount of data .
But it &apos;s not enough just to have data and measure it .
You need to be able to do something with it .
Okay , so let &apos;s have a look at a little bit of data .
It was deemed to be an unpredictable event .
So the question is , why couldn &apos;t we see it ?
Was this a predictable event ?
It &apos;s a patient with a heart problem .
And then we started looking at the data .
It &apos;s telling us that something is going wrong .
We call it the cloud of normality .
There &apos;s no rocket science here .
So we have a very ambitious program .
We think that the race is on to do something differently .
We are thinking big . It &apos;s the right thing to do .
It can go beyond the walls .
Thank you very much .
James Randi : Homeopathy , quackery and fraud
Good morning .
Now , how do we go about that sort of thing ?
It &apos;s a beard trimmer , you see ?
You believe I &apos;m looking at you .
These are not glasses , these are empty frames .
Quite empty frames .
Don &apos;t you ever forget that .
I haven &apos;t had a good look . Well , it &apos;s not that great a convenience .
But I &apos;m going to take some medication .
This is a full bottle of Calms Forte .
I &apos;ll explain that in just a moment .
I will take enough of these . Mm .
Indeed , the whole container .
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte .
I &apos;m an actor who plays a specific part .
Oh , they gladly sell you that , yes .
You might agree with me on that .
I wonder if that &apos;s true .
Good bye . &quot;
And she didn &apos;t answer the damn question !
Where is the will ?
Is this a hunting game ?
Hunting and fishing ? What is it ?
Is it 20 questions ? No , it &apos;s more like 120 questions .
Now , this is a process that is called cold reading .
He &apos;s one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing .
Folks , that &apos;s what dying is all about !
You stop breathing , and then you &apos;re dead .
It &apos;s that simple .
I don &apos;t think so .
&quot; Did he ever have an electric razor ? &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
This is what they go through .
Now , Sylvia Browne is the big operator .
We call her &quot; The Talons . &quot;
That &apos;s her , you can tell right away .
Now , Montel Williams is an intelligent man .
We all know who he is on television .
He just doesn &apos;t care .
Duh .
He isn &apos;t worth bringing back , obviously .
Very simply won .
It &apos;s very easy , win the million dollars .
Duh .
I &apos;m alive , you may have noticed .
Well , pretty well anyway .
Now these people need to be stopped , seriously now .
We get people coming to the foundation all the time .
Now , I popped some pills earlier .
I have to explain that to you .
Homeopathy , let &apos;s find out what that &apos;s all about .
Hmm . You &apos;ve heard of it .
It &apos;s an alternative form of healing , right ?
Homeopathy actually consists -- and that &apos;s what this is .
Why don &apos;t they affect me ?
The answer may surprise you .
What is homeopathy ?
Diluting it down to the point where there &apos;s none of it left .
Now that is true . That is what homeopathy is all about .
The poor man , he was on homeopathic medicine .
He died of an overdose .
He forgot to take his pill .
Work on it . Work on it .
It &apos;s a ridiculous thing . It is absolutely ridiculous .
They might , some place out there .
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy .
Well , with Sylvia Browne I would think so .
I mean that &apos;s a fabulous amount of money .
If you find out -- now I understand .
Largely , it &apos;s the media who are to blame for this sort of thing .
It &apos;s the bottom line , the dollar line .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re looking at .
We really must do something about this .
It &apos;s www.randi.org.
You will see the records that we have .
She did accept and then backed away .
Thank you .
They started with two and they ended with two .
So you can imagine the scale of this problem .
These kids in Pakistan don &apos;t go to school .
They are lucky . They already have a job .
In China , recycling is a major issue .
And they are having great fun .
And they squirt the water into their mouths .
So we need a better product . And we need better information .
So , it &apos;s a normal-looking syringe .
You give the injection and then put it down .
It &apos;s very , very simple . Thank you .
And it costs the same as a normal syringe .
Thank you very much .
Deb Roy : The birth of a word
Okay .
DR : He sure nailed it , didn &apos;t he .
So he didn &apos;t just learn water .
He was an early talker .
And so we started to analyze why .
Why were certain words born before others ?
And the &#91; horizontal &#93; axis is time .
And we would plot the relative length of the utterances .
But that &apos;s looking at the speech context .
What about the visual context ?
So welcome to my home .
That &apos;s me and my son on the floor .
The spiral thread we call a &quot; solo hot spot . &quot;
So here &apos;s how we &apos;re approaching this .
He &apos;s leaving red ink behind .
And there &apos;s our nanny by the door .
Nanny : You want water ?
Nanny : All right .
And what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape .
We call these wordscapes .
We can take the word &quot; bye &quot; as in &quot; good bye . &quot;
And the same idea now can be built up .
And then the important third dimension .
And there are fascinating dynamics at play .
It &apos;s not one way .
They talk to other people .
We &apos;ve given this person a name .
And he was quiet for a moment .
And I thought , &quot; What am I thinking ?
And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is powerful stuff . &quot;
Listen very carefully .
And so let &apos;s fly back in time to that memorable moment .
DR : Hey .
Come here .
Can you do it ?
Oh , boy .
Can you do it ?
Baby : Yeah .
DR : Ma , he &apos;s walking .
DR : Thank you .
Jill Sobule + Julia Sweeney : The Jill and Julia Show
Dorothy Parker , mean , drunk and depressed . Sweeney : I know .
Founding fathers all had slaves . Sweeney : I know .
Lewis Carroll I &apos;m sure did Alice . Sweeney : What ? !
It makes &quot; The DaVinci Code &quot; seem like &quot; War and Peace . &quot;
So that &apos;s what I have to say .
So I wanted to come up with something of my own .
&apos;I failed ! &apos; He cried .
I love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow .
I believe in time -- very important .
And the third one was , never criticize a teammate .
It &apos;s a little different than it was in my day .
And those actually came from my dad .
And right at the top -- faith and patience .
And they are . They want to change everything .
They think all change is progress .
So you must have patience .
And I believe that we must have faith .
But it all revolved around that original definition of success .
He spelled Moriarty with only one &apos; i &apos; .
Don &apos;t whine . Don &apos;t complain . Don &apos;t make excuses .
And no one can do more than that .
And you can win when you &apos;re outscored .
But I &apos;d want one that would play offense too .
I wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside .
I mention in my book , &quot; They Call Me Coach . &quot;
Somebody else is in there ahead of them .
And so they played pretty good defense for us .
Have I rambled enough ?
This is actually a story of my own backyard .
There was no one to relate publicly to .
For them , the Headwaters is a kitchen .
It &apos;s a sanctuary . It &apos;s a burial ground of their ancestors .
Thank you very much .
We live in an incredibly busy world .
Just 10 minutes , undisturbed ?
Simply doing nothing .
I see a lot of very blank faces .
And this is an extraordinary thing , right ?
We &apos;re talking about our mind .
The result , of course , is that we get stressed .
That &apos;s really not how it has to be .
You get stressed , you do some meditation .
It was a really very stressful time .
But it was more than that .
I think the present moment is so underrated .
Forty-seven percent .
But we need to know how to do it .
That &apos;s essentially what meditation is .
It &apos;s familiarizing ourselves with the present moment .
Of course in meditation — — we &apos;re going to end up falling asleep .
Let &apos;s say this is an anxious thought .
But what do you do every 20 , 30 seconds ?
That &apos;s the potential of meditation , of mindfulness .
Thank you very much .
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution .
And how big a problem is this ?
And what are their options ?
It &apos;s got a microprocessor inside .
This is a low-end titanium knee .
And he &apos;s doing a 10-meter walk test .
Now this is a video of Kamal .
And you can see his stability is much better .
It &apos;s also about human performance .
We see that they squat . They kneel in prayer .
What is the local market like ?
Notice anything about it ?
It clicks .
So do you see that black strip right there ?
That &apos;s a homemade noise dampener .
He &apos;d made a cosmesis .
So I &apos;m going to show you some of the modifications we did .
We made it thinner .
It also has to be designed to be very affordable .
The industry average is about 65 percent .
This is where we want to get , though , in the next three years .
So thank you .
This is our group , our main group of weavers .
They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
They all have bank accounts .
They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .
Sherwin Nuland : The extraordinary power of ordinary people
This is my third visit to TED .
And this gives me enormous hope .
Well , it reminds me a little bit of surgery .
And that &apos;s the way it is with definitions of words .
There are different paradigms .
He said , &quot; I think so . &quot;
So , here &apos;s what it is : I &apos;ll repeat it .
&quot; The world will not be saved by the Internet . &quot;
We feel it at concerts .
It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves .
What is it that they have every right to ask of us ?
Well , you know precisely what it is .
So , here we are .
And I &apos;ll read you what it is .
Thank you very much .
Margaret Gould Stewart : How YouTube thinks about copyright
And the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking .
Remember Chris Brown &apos;s video &quot; Forever &quot; ?
This is their wedding video .
You may have seen it .
I mean , who are these people ?
I totally want to go to that wedding .
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these .
There &apos;s musical labels .
There &apos;s multiple music publishers .
And each of these can vary by country .
But it &apos;s not just about dollars and impressions .
Thank you .
What makes a great leader today ?
The odds are , probably not .
I want to share some of those with you now .
Who are you spending time with ? On what topics ?
Where are you traveling ? What are you reading ?
Great leaders are not head-down .
Great leaders dare to be different .
I &apos;ve met many , and they stand out .
Thank you .
Mike deGruy : Hooked by an octopus
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature .
But the octopus did .
Maybe I can do this all the time .
Yeah , I &apos;ll be a filmmaker . &quot;
It &apos;s been a good ride .
And after the first week , they ignored us .
It was fantastic .
And octopus are , they live in all the oceans .
They also live deep .
It &apos;s like nothing you &apos;ve ever done .
And it gets quiet .
And it starts getting really nice .
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.
And it completely threw science on its head .
There &apos;s no hot water .
But 10 miles down the ridge ...
pshhh ! There &apos;s another volcano going .
And you show up , and it &apos;s dead .
You think , &quot; Well , what happened ? &quot;
And over here there &apos;s a golf course going in .
And this is the tropics .
It &apos;s raining like crazy here .
But , encouragingly , I &apos;ve seen just the opposite .
I &apos;ve been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay .
Well , how it happened is the local community galvanized .
Indeed , it &apos;s the only thing that ever has .
I &apos;m a big fan of grassroots organizations .
I &apos;m an individual . I &apos;m one person .
Fair enough question .
Look in your own backyard .
Look in your heart , actually .
And fix it .
So that &apos;s how I answer that question .
And do that , and spread the word .
In theory , we &apos;re thinking , rational human beings .
And I applaud that . I loudly applaud that .
And that I do .
Thank you very much .
Andy Hobsbawm : Do the green thing
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
This is a time of need .
Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
Sure , she had aged a little .
In fact , she had aged a lot .
Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot;
The earth moved for both of them .
And they lived together happily ever after .
Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
The moral imperative is on the table .
Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
Sting : How I started writing songs again
I &apos;d watch those same men walking back home every night .
I was fairly determined that it wouldn &apos;t be .
So far , so good , right ?
So you start asking yourself questions .
Is the gift of songwriting taken away as easily as it seems to have been bestowed ?
Or perhaps there &apos;s a more -- a deeper psychological reason .
It was always a Faustian pact anyway .
Well they say , write what you know .
This is Jackie White .
He &apos;s the foreman of the shipyard .
I &apos;m not very happy with her .
Inside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother .
This is a big deal .
I see her , and she seems to see me .
She acknowledges me . She waves , and she smiles .
And I wave my flag even more vigorously .
She &apos;s acknowledged me .
And then she &apos;s gone .
Well , I wasn &apos;t cured of anything .
It was the opposite , actually .
I was infected .
I was infected with an idea .
I don &apos;t belong in this street .
I don &apos;t want to live in that house .
I don &apos;t want to end up in that shipyard .
I want to be in that car .
I want a bigger life .
I want a life beyond this town .
I want a life that &apos;s out of the ordinary .
It &apos;s my right .
It &apos;s my right as much as hers .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Okay , you have to join in if you know it .
It &apos;s very easy . Sing in unison .
Here we go .
Hawa Abdi + Deqo Mohamed : Mother and daughter doctor-heroes
So there was no job , no food .
So our patients are women and children .
And they are in our backyard .
It &apos;s our home . We welcome them .
There is no government to protect them .
It is very tough .
That &apos;s their house .
We are sharing with them whatever we have .
But there are only two rules .
That &apos;s our two rules .
We can reconcile .
We can do everything .
So we came up with these two rules .
So if you beat your wife , you &apos;re going to be there .
PM : You &apos;re running a medical clinic .
You &apos;re also running a civil society .
I admired them , and I decided to become a doctor .
Then my father allowed me to proceed &#91; with &#93; my hope .
That &apos;s why I became a doctor .
So Dr. Deqo has to explain .
Maybe I should become an historian , or maybe a reporter .
So that &apos;s how I decided &#91; to do &#93; the same .
My sister was different .
She &apos;s here . She &apos;s also a doctor .
She graduated in Russia also .
Most people fled abroad .
I succeeded in my place .
And I &apos;m thankful for my daughters .
They do everything for them .
They have done what I desire to do for them .
She &apos;s very tough ; it &apos;s most challenging .
She always expects us to do more .
That &apos;s the best part .
Wait . Wait .
H Thank you .
Thank you .
H Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
Eduardo Paes : The 4 commandments of cities
It &apos;s a great honor to be here .
That &apos;s the place to be .
Actually it was a very hard challenge .
We had to beat the European monarchy .
This is Juan Carlos , king of Spain .
We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology .
So it was not easy at all .
We really showed that , yes , we can .
It &apos;s a difficult task to deal with cities .
I want you all to imagine Rio .
Bird : This is incredible .
We &apos;re like every big city in the world .
It &apos;s like the heart of the suburb in Rio .
The temperature &apos;s going to drop two , three degrees centigrade .
You &apos;ve got to think green and green .
So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you .
cities are packed with people .
So how do you move these people around ?
But there is a problem .
High-capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money .
And it &apos;s something that we &apos;re doing , again , lots in Rio .
It &apos;s the BRT , the Bus Rapid Transit .
You transform it inside as a train car .
You use separate lanes , dedicated lanes .
The contractors , they don &apos;t like that .
You don &apos;t have to dig deep down underground .
You can build nice stations .
This is actually a station that we &apos;re doing in Rio .
This is a map of Rio .
Moving to the third commandment .
And this is the most controversial one .
Let me just show a map of Rio again .
All these red parts are favelas .
So you see , they are spread all over the city .
You see the contrast between the rich and poor .
I &apos;m going to give a fast example here .
We call it a family clinic .
Bring infrastructure to the favelas , to the slums , wherever you are .
Between November and May , Rio &apos;s completely packed .
We just had last week Carnivale .
It was great . It was lots of fun .
We have New Year &apos;s Eve .
There &apos;s like two million people on Copacabana Beach .
We have problems .
We fight floods , tropical rains at this time of the year .
We have problems with the tropical rains .
This was something we did with IBM that &apos;s a little bit more than a year old .
It &apos;s what we call the Operations Center of Rio .
We &apos;re going to speak now to the Operations Center .
So Osorio , good to be there with you .
So how &apos;s the weather in Rio now ?
Osorio : The weather is fine . We have fair weather today .
Let me get you our weather satellite radar .
You see just a little bit of moisture around the city .
EP : Okay , how &apos;s the traffic ?
We , at this time of year , get lots of traffic jams .
People get mad at the mayor . So how &apos;s the traffic tonight ?
Osario : Well traffic tonight is fine .
A live transmission in downtown Rio for you , Mr. Mayor .
You see , the streets are clear .
Now it &apos;s 11 : 00 pm in Rio .
Nothing of concern in terms of traffic .
I &apos;ll get to you now the incidents of the day .
These are the cars .
Osorio : Absolutely , Mr. Mayor .
Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks .
This is live transmission .
We have GPS &apos;s in all of our trucks .
Waste collection on time .
Public services working well .
EP : Okay , Osorio , thank you very much .
It was great to have you here .
And we cannot see that as a problem .
That is fantastic .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know where we are now .
And similar topography .
I wonder why .
And this is art . This is metaphor .
And I said , &quot; So what were you doing ? &quot;
How does that work ? &quot;
It &apos;s not just going to disappear .
That &apos;s good .
What &apos;s your act two ?
What do you do when you grow up ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , financial services . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh . &quot;
And I said , &quot; How does that work ? &quot;
And it &apos;s also sometimes called algo trading , algorithmic trading . &quot;
You just tip your hand .
And all of that &apos;s great , and it &apos;s fine .
And what could go wrong ?
Nobody had any control over what was actually happening .
And we &apos;re starting to make our way .
It &apos;s out of print -- still ...
And as with Amazon , so it is with Netflix .
They &apos;re using Pragmatic Chaos now .
Wouldn &apos;t that be handy ?
And the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t Google .
This isn &apos;t information .
These aren &apos;t financial stats ; this is culture .
What would it look like ?
These are two algorithms competing for your living room .
It &apos;s super-real and it &apos;s happening around you .
And the problem with that is that people freak out .
People panic .
And you see why . You see why .
Like the things that people use .
And this is what we &apos;re designing for .
We &apos;re designing for this machine dialect .
You can take it really , really far .
So let me take it back to Wall Street .
And that &apos;s going to keep happening .
Unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
This is just theoretical .
This is some mathematicians at MIT .
And it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s so interesting actually .
Thank you .
JP Rangaswami : Information is food
I love my food .
And I love information .
That was the family business .
And I mean books everywhere around the house .
It wasn &apos;t the only passion I had .
I was a South Indian brought up in Bengal .
So by the time I grew up , again , I had a well-established passion for food .
And then life was fine , dandy .
It &apos;s a lady named Leslie Aiello .
We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information .
So there was always going to be a tension within that .
And this is happening here .
The same is again true with information .
They &apos;d buy it from the shop as raw ingredients .
Do you go to a restaurant ?
And by this time I was hooked .
Which brings me to the final element of this .
Fundamentally it &apos;s a consumption issue .
Would there be time to be able to work with it ?
Gary Slutkin : Let &apos;s treat violence like a contagious disease
There were many epidemics there .
After 10 years of working overseas , I was exhausted .
I really had very little left .
I had been traveling to one country after another .
I was emotionally feeling very isolated .
I wanted to come home .
In fact -- seriously .
How many of you have such a situation ?
And now I do that .
And one was punishment .
And this I had heard about before .
And I &apos;d heard this before as well .
Diarrheal diseases had been stuck .
Malaria had been stuck .
Frequently , a strategy has to be rethought .
What do the graphs look like ?
What does the data look like ?
There was clustering .
Make sense ?
And there &apos;s special workers for doing that .
Just like T.B. , but the object is behavior change .
They were using parks they weren &apos;t using before .
The sun was out . Everybody was happy .
And since that time , this has been replicated 20 times .
What do you mean , epidemic ?
What do you mean , no bad guys ?
You must be doing something right . &quot;
So I didn &apos;t mean to come up with this at all .
Thank you .
Jakob Trollback : A new kind of music video
And the song began to move on I understand like this .
And when Noah had done built his Ark ...
Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...
And then he went and knocked an old lady house .
And old lady ran to the door and say , &quot; Who is it ? &quot;
Because we &apos;re far from home , we &apos;re very tired . &quot;
And the old lady said , &quot; Oh yes , come on in . &quot;
It was come dark and rain , will make you weary and tired .
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri .
I was going to work with small farmers .
I was going to help alleviate poverty .
You could be in New York .
It &apos;s not the work I set out to do .
I met a guy -- the guy on the left .
His name was Ben .
I said , &quot; Well , Ben , what do you do ? &quot;
&quot; I make ice cream . &quot;
He said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
Within a year , Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves .
It was a great success .
That gets your adrenaline going .
A great success .
It failed .
Why did it fail ?
We were attacking the wrong driver .
We needed to be working on beef .
We needed to be working on lumber .
So let &apos;s go back to Sudan .
Okay . Fast forward .
We live on a planet .
There &apos;s just one of them .
We know the limits of the resources we have .
We may be able to use them differently .
We may have some innovative , new ideas .
But in general , this is what we &apos;ve got .
There &apos;s a basic equation that we can &apos;t get away from .
Now we &apos;re at 1.3 .
This is where we stand today .
It &apos;s always population growth .
But it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about lifestyles .
You think that &apos;s not an issue going forward ?
Let &apos;s go back and visit our equation .
We have six billion units of consumption .
So we &apos;re going to have 18 billion units of consumption .
But that &apos;s what the math says .
We &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
We can get productivity up .
We can get efficiency up .
But we &apos;ve also got to get consumption down .
We need to use less to make more .
And then we need to use less again .
And then we need to consume less .
The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.
Okay , so let &apos;s be generous .
Let &apos;s say it &apos;s 3.5 seconds in Europe .
How do you get informed ?
You don &apos;t .
Here &apos;s a little question .
In every single case , the answer is &quot; it depends . &quot;
And there are many others .
They &apos;re not .
Sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue .
It &apos;s got to be something we all care about .
And we need collusion .
We need Cargill to work with Bunge .
We need Coke to work with Pepsi .
We need Oxford to work with Cambridge .
We need Greenpeace to work with WWF .
Everybody &apos;s got to work together -- China and the U.S.
But we can &apos;t do everything .
We need to focus on the where , the what and the who .
We have to work in these places .
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers ?
Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers ?
Again , a daunting task .
There must be a better way .
So , we went through our 15 commodities .
This is nine of them .
And what we found is it &apos;s 25 percent .
We can get our arms around a hundred companies .
A hundred companies , we can work with .
Why is 25 percent important ?
We can &apos;t wait that long .
We don &apos;t have that kind of time .
We need change that &apos;s going to accelerate .
We need to begin to work with industries .
It &apos;s not all fun and games .
Eight entities came to the table .
It can happen .
So what brings the different entities to the table ?
It &apos;s risk and demand .
If they don &apos;t have commodities , they don &apos;t have a business .
So it &apos;s the demand that brings them to the table .
So we &apos;re pulling out all the stops .
Why is Cargill important ?
That &apos;s not insignificant .
It &apos;s a pre-competitive issue .
All the palm oil going there is good .
Buy it .
Mars is also on a similar journey .
The rest of the land can be used for something else .
That is an externality by definition .
This is the subsidy from nature .
These companies have begun to think differently .
They &apos;re on a journey ; there &apos;s no turning back .
We &apos;re all on that same journey with them .
Thank you .
Elizabeth Lindsey : Curating humanity &apos;s heritage
The year is 1963 .
We &apos;re at the ocean .
It &apos;s twilight .
We &apos;re watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides .
It &apos;s a stretch of beach we know so well .
The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us .
That would be a mistake .
There &apos;s a new moon on the horizon .
They begin to chant .
They want to teach me about my destiny .
I thought every seven-year-old went through this .
&quot; Baby girl , someday the world will be in trouble .
People will forget their wisdom .
You will go far away .
It will sometimes be a lonely road .
We will not be there .
And it will take all of you .
It will take all of you . &quot;
Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me .
The year is 2007 .
I &apos;m on a remote island in Micronesia .
Satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide .
It &apos;s the home of my mentor .
His name is Pius Mau Piailug .
Mau is a palu , a navigator priest .
This is part of our collective narrative .
It &apos;s humanity &apos;s DNA .
We cannot afford to lose it .
The year is 2010 .
We must course-correct .
The link between the past and the future is fragile .
It always was .
True navigation begins in the human heart .
It &apos;s the most important map of all .
Together , may we journey well .
Barton Seaver : Sustainable seafood ? Let &apos;s get smart
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know how I impact them .
I want to know how they impact me .
I want to know why they fish .
So what do we call this ?
Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
Pole caught -- no bycatch .
What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
Whooo !
This is an easy sell .
There &apos;s a pattern here .
So let &apos;s start there .
We have eco-friendly shrimp .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
It doesn &apos;t work .
But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
This is great .
This is what we need to favor .
This is what the green list says .
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
Put it on four plates .
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
I expect a lot from food .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
I remember well the meals of my childhood .
This is still how I largely eat today .
I get the meat sweats .
It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
It &apos;s disgusting .
Eat your vegetables .
It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
So what are we looking for in a meal ?
For community though , we start at the very beginning .
We need to savor vegetables .
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
And we need to save dinner .
Thank you .
Rives : A mockingbird remix of TED2006
Mockingbirds are badass .
They are .
They rock the mic outside my window every morning .
Oh , I &apos;m going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound .
I &apos;ll get your postman making dinner plans .
I &apos;ll get the last time you lied .
I &apos;ll get everyone &apos;s good mornings .
I don &apos;t care how you make &apos; em .
Aloha . Konichiwa . Shalom . Ah-Salam Alaikum .
Everybody means everybody , means everybody here .
And so maybe I &apos;ll build a gilded cage .
I &apos;ll line the bottom with old notebook pages .
What does a violin have to do with technology ?
Where in the world is this world heading ?
We are 12 billion light years from the edge .
That &apos;s a guess .
Everybody gets heard .
And I &apos;m on this .
Wait for the man with the mockingbird . &quot;
Thank you , TED .
Wow .
Wow .
Holly Morris : Why stay in Chernobyl ? Because it &apos;s home .
So I was filming .
But they are .
They &apos;re called self-settlers .
They did so illegally .
Otherwise , I &apos;m going home . &quot;
Now why would they return to such deadly soil ?
The dead zone , it turns out , is full of life .
And there &apos;s a patina of simple defiance among them .
I mean , what about their health ?
It &apos;s incredibly difficult to parse .
Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught .
Home is a transient concept .
&quot; If you leave , you die . &quot;
They are dying of sadness . &quot;
&quot; Motherland is motherland . I will never leave . &quot;
How could this be ?
Thank you .
Marcin Jakubowski : Open-sourced blueprints for civilization
Hi , my name is Marcin -- farmer , technologist .
So let me tell you a story .
I had no practical skills .
I bought a tractor -- then it broke .
Then pretty soon , I was broke too .
So I did just that .
And I tested them .
So far , we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines .
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too .
That &apos;s not only in the developing world .
Thank you .
Neil Harbisson : I listen to color
For example , this is the sound of grass .
This is red , like TED .
This is the sound of a dirty sock .
Which is like yellow , this one .
I didn &apos;t have to think about the notes .
And after some time , this perception became a feeling .
This is my passport from 2004 .
It &apos;s like going to a nightclub .
It &apos;s full of different melodies . Yeah .
Especially the aisle with cleaning products .
It &apos;s just fabulous .
Also , the way I dress has changed .
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good .
Here &apos;s some faces .
Yeah , Nicole Kidman sounds good .
Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman .
They have similar sound of eyes .
And here &apos;s some music translated into color .
And this is a completely different song .
It &apos;s Justin Bieber &apos;s &quot; Baby . &quot;
It is very pink and very yellow .
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel .
I would encourage you to become a cyborg .
You won &apos;t be alone . Thank you .
Clay Shirky : How cognitive surplus will change the world
And she quickly said , &quot; It &apos;s too much .
And it &apos;s been used most famously in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake .
That is the resource that I &apos;m talking about .
I call it cognitive surplus .
Cognitive surplus is made up of two things .
The first , obviously , is the world &apos;s free time and talents .
That &apos;s the second half of cognitive surplus .
We still like to consume , of course .
But it turns out we also like to create , and we like to share .
Designing .
We &apos;re also getting , of course , a lot of LOLcats .
But media abundance never works that way .
Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .
And that source is design for generosity .
Simple , straightforward , commonsensical -- also , largely untested .
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups .
Boom . No ifs , ands or buts . &quot;
And you can see immediately what happened , right ?
The fine broke the culture of the daycare center .
What could be bad ? &quot;
But that &apos;s not right .
This is , I think , the range that matters .
Both of these rely on cognitive surplus .
Ushahidi , by contrast , is civic value .
We &apos;ve got a choice before us .
We &apos;ve got this trillion hours a year .
That , we get for free .
we &apos;ll be able to change society .
Thank you very much .
Majora Carter : 3 stories of local eco-entrepreneurship
The first one is happening right here in Chicago .
Talk about a sweet beginning .
Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner &apos;s daughter .
The water is turned into goo .
Not quite an obvious alliance .
Yeah .
So I &apos;m so proud of that .
Now they &apos;re all very practical visionaries .
I think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
And there are plenty of other examples like that .
One problem : waste handling and unemployment .
They &apos;ve since abandoned that project , thank goodness .
The numbers just aren &apos;t there .
This is smart infrastructure .
These examples indicate a trend .
And we all need to be invested in it .
And I call it &quot; hometown security . &quot;
The sum of the local is the global .
See , my dad was a great , great man in many ways .
But , like all of us , he had some problems .
And his was gambling , compulsively .
So you need to help him out .
So I &apos;m not that unhappy about that .
But I did in fact get married in it .
Over here .
Thank you very much .
Brian Cox : CERN &apos;s supercollider
This is the Large Hadron Collider .
It &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference .
It &apos;s the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .
We collide them inside giant detectors .
They &apos;re essentially digital cameras .
And this is the one that I work on , ATLAS .
This is a picture about a year ago .
Those magnets are in there .
Yeah , it &apos;s a wonderful achievement .
So , you might be asking , &quot; Why ?
Absolutely everything .
It &apos;s almost like ...
But , without it , the sun wouldn &apos;t shine .
Just up the road .
Relative to the universe , it &apos;s just up the road .
It &apos;s the Newton &apos;s laws , if you want , of particle physics .
This is it .
But there &apos;s a problem .
Can anyone see what it is ?
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me .
But there &apos;s an extra symbol in this equation : H.
Right , H.
H stands for Higgs particle .
Higgs particles have not been discovered .
So it &apos;s a prediction : a prediction of a new particle .
What does it do ?
Well , we had a long time to come up with good analogies .
I want to know what this Higgs particle does . &quot;
Higgs particles , if you will .
They &apos;re surrounded by people , and their passage through the room is impeded .
And that &apos;s exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works .
They &apos;re interacting with the Higgs field .
So that &apos;s one thing .
That &apos;s essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find .
Well , they do change in strength .
But they just miss .
Many other things that the LHC could discover .
Gravity separated away from the other forces .
The universe continued to expand and cool .
It continued to expand about 300 million years .
Then light began to travel through the universe .
Absolutely remarkable .
And , the laws of physics . Right ?
So that &apos;s the LHC .
Thanks .
Lisa Harouni : A primer on 3D printing
This is a 3D printer .
Many barriers are breaking down .
So how does it work ?
They were all 3D printed .
The design is quite extraordinary .
It sounds great .
It is great .
This is almost three meters high .
This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro .
And you can actually walk into it .
And on the other end of the spectrum , this is a microstructure .
So really the resolution is quite incredible .
The detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
So who &apos;s using it ?
There &apos;s very little economies of scale .
So you can now create one-offs very easily .
Again , not buildable in any other way .
And very hard to even create this by hand .
Now this is an engine component .
It &apos;s very , very , very detailed inside with the design .
And it &apos;s used by aerospace and automotive .
There &apos;s a lower chance of rejection .
You &apos;re having machines fabricate themselves .
You can just make it physically on the spot .
Brands like Nike are doing it .
It &apos;s all over the Web .
This is a lamp .
And you can start iterating the design .
You can direct what color that product will be , perhaps what material .
And also , you can engage in shape manipulation of that product , but within boundaries that are safe .
The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible .
But I don &apos;t think that that &apos;s immediate .
I don &apos;t think that will happen soon .
This means lower carbon footprint .
Here &apos;s the product being built .
It &apos;s this lamp , as you can see here .
You know , this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree .
It &apos;s very intricate .
So just to finalize , we &apos;re all individual .
We all have different preferences , different needs .
We like different things .
We &apos;re all different sizes and our companies the same .
Businesses want different things .
Thank you .
Homaro Cantu + Ben Roche : Cooking as alchemy
Ben Roche : So I &apos;m Ben , by the way .
Homaro Cantu : And I &apos;m Homaro .
HC : Delicious .
BR : That &apos;s not it , though .
So this is a plate of nachos .
You see a cow with its tongue hanging out .
And why is it delicious ?
And basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this .
They &apos;re hard to just get automatically .
But where is this going ?
So here &apos;s the next challenge .
BR : Thanks , guys .
Tavi Gevinson : A teen just trying to figure it out
So the flaws are the key .
I &apos;m not the first person to say this .
Congrats , guys .
You can &apos;t be smart and pretty .
You can &apos;t be a feminist who &apos;s also interested in fashion .
But , yeah .
I got about 3,000 emails .
If you use that , you can get away with anything .
Like , that &apos;s all you have to do .
Thank you .
Rob Reid : The $ 8 billion iPod
... if we use pennies .
And TV , satellite and cable revenues are way up .
So this small missing chunk here is puzzling .
It &apos;s true .
I have Excel .
And it was a big Christmas hit .
Or about 75,000 jobs .
So that &apos;s it for now .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Judy MacDonald Johnston : Prepare for a good end of life
What would be a good end of life ?
And I &apos;m talking about the very end .
I &apos;m talking about dying .
I &apos;m not a geriatrician .
I design reading programs for preschoolers .
This was their dream .
I met Jim and Shirley in their 80s .
They were both only children who chose not to have kids .
It &apos;s true .
This gave them the peace of mind to move forward .
From this experience I &apos;m going to share five practices .
It starts with a plan .
Most people say , &quot; I &apos;d like to die at home . &quot;
This is not a plan either ; this is illegal .
Where do you want to be when you &apos;re no longer independent ?
What do you want in terms of medical intervention ?
You will need advocates .
Hospital readiness is critical .
Tape a set to your refrigerator .
You &apos;re going to need caregivers .
Finally , last words .
So , this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial .
Thank you .
Ellen Gustafson : Obesity + hunger = 1 global food issue
I &apos;m Ellen , and I &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
But I didn &apos;t start out obsessed with food .
I think about eating a lot , and I really love it .
&quot; What are you doing for America &apos;s kids ? &quot;
I mean that &apos;s pretty dramatic for our own country .
The numbers are pretty crazy .
Well , they &apos;re both about food .
And agriculture is where food comes from .
Well , agriculture in America &apos;s very interesting .
And their farms are also large .
It &apos;s crazy .
Hello . You don &apos;t put soda in bottles .
I think that &apos;s the only way to look at it .
You know , there &apos;s 30-year cycles .
And it &apos;ll be growing over the next few months .
Two young scientists break down plastics with bacteria
How do you feel about accidents ?
But are they always that bad ?
And what about the waste that &apos;s already been produced ?
Plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade .
So we thought , you know what ?
Sounds cool , right ?
Audience : Yeah . JY : Thank you .
But we had a problem .
As a result , they easily escape into our environment .
MW : Okay . Well , it was partially my fault .
But this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous .
As a result , we had to streak and restreak several times .
This means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates .
Thank you . JY : Thank you .
Ghosts , right ?
Taking them off the dead , flat pages .
Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn .
Here she is .
And here &apos;s her poem .
The next poem is &quot; If No One Ever Marries Me . &quot;
It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema .
One was his daughter , Laurence .
Thank you .
Gerard Manley Hopkins , a saintly man .
He became a Jesuit .
He converted from his Anglican faith .
And the poem is called , &quot; Spring and Fall . &quot;
Thank you .
Just bring it down a little .
It &apos;s my turn .
I still have two minutes .
Okay , we &apos;re going to start that verse again .
I have so much admiration for him .
Decrescendo .
Gradually , bringing it down , bringing it down .
I want to thank you , thank you Finger popping , ain &apos;t no stopping .
Thank you so much .
We were making what was invisible visible .
I &apos;ve been doing this for 30 years .
Why do I believe this ?
Because it &apos;s true .
It is absolutely true .
Sixty-four percent . Now , how did we get there ?
Our eyes were wide open .
There was no justice .
And you know what else we did ?
Right ?
I was probably 30 and naive .
The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act .
Thank you .
In fact , I am a data nerd .
Where &apos;s dinner ?
Please don &apos;t — Let go of me !
That &apos;s what hurts ! That &apos;s what hurts !
Help me !
The media became fixated .
And let me just put this in context .
I &apos;ll tell you : 158 .
We were obviously making a difference .
But we were still missing a critical element .
I apologize to the men in the audience .
I know you do .
They do talk to their kids .
And that &apos;s what we did .
We met men where they were at and we built a program .
She sat right down next to him .
We &apos;ve done a lot for adult women .
We just do . We have to .
Technology has been our friend .
Really . I clap for you .
You can &apos;t make that one up .
Thank you very much .
Edward Burtynsky : Photographing the landscape of oil
I started my journey 30 years ago .
It was 23 metric tons for one liter .
And together they only form about 15 years of supply .
Henry Markram : A brain in a supercomputer
Why are we doing this ?
There are three important reasons .
It runs out of space .
He &apos;s at home having tea .
We can ask a very concrete question .
Is it capable of doing it ?
It had to improve it a little bit .
But the real big step was the neocortex .
It &apos;s a new brain . You needed it .
But it &apos;s not only education .
It &apos;s also genetics .
It &apos;s a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest .
How many trees does it have ?
What shapes are the trees ?
How many of each type of tree do you have ? Where are they positioned ?
They choose very carefully who they connect with .
And here we &apos;re coiling them up .
Every neuron is different .
Well , we don &apos;t have to speculate .
We can look at all 10 million synapses now .
We can use less or more of them .
But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not .
And we &apos;ve got the mathematics to describe this process .
So you need 10,000 laptops .
Take the magic carpet for a ride .
It &apos;s the first view .
But we can ask , &quot; Where is the rose ? &quot;
Where is it inside the neocortex ?
Because that is what it &apos;s creating .
It &apos;s creating electrical patterns .
Antonio Damasio : The quest to understand consciousness
And this is a person who is alive .
This is not a person that is being studied at autopsy .
But at any rate , they are there .
At any rate , what is consciousness ?
What is a conscious mind ?
That flow of mental images is mind .
We have selves .
We own our minds .
Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular .
On the right side , my retina is perfectly symmetrical .
So from the retina you go onto visual cortex .
But what about the self ?
The self is really the elusive problem .
And I thought about a solution to this problem .
It &apos;s the following .
Well it so happens that we have a singular body .
We have one body , not two , not three .
And so that is a beginning .
There is just one reference point , which is the body .
It is that specific .
So now I &apos;m going to show you a picture .
So what is the picture that we get here ?
But look at the arrows .
They &apos;re not there for looks .
That &apos;s where the difference is .
But the novelty is here .
It is developed in the cultures .
It developed in collectives of human beings .
Three reasons . First , curiosity .
Second , understanding society and culture .
And finally , medicine .
Thank you for your attention .
Paul Bennett : Design is in the details
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about today .
This is 59 seconds into the film .
This is a minute 59 .
3 : 19 .
5 : 10 .
5 : 58 .
6 : 20 .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like to be a patient in the hospital .
So they snapped into action .
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling .
And he invented the shipping container .
Again , another medical example here .
They &apos;ll ask the nurses to input data .
And I think that &apos;s really , really important .
So , again , this idea of workarounds .
Why do we all follow the line in the street ?
This is a picture in a Japanese subway .
We don &apos;t know why , but we do .
This stuff is really important . This stuff is really vital . &quot;
This is people designing their own experiences .
You can draw from this .
I talk about unthinking situations all the time .
This is the Billy bookcase -- it &apos;s IKEA &apos;s biggest selling product .
But big selling bookcase . How do we replicate this for children ?
Children assume permission in a very different way .
Children live on things . They live under things .
So , what came out of this ?
This is the storage system that he designed .
And then use that information to fuel solutions ?
Last section : green armband . We &apos;ve all got them .
It &apos;s about this really .
They &apos;re now called KickStart .
And that was completely irrelevant .
These guys are using this very successfully .
We feel that this is an important gesture .
I hope you &apos;ll all wear them .
So that &apos;s it . Thank you .
Eric X. Li : A tale of two political systems
Good morning .
But no , I wasn &apos;t born there .
It went like this .
Communism !
And the Chinese bought it .
We were taught that grand story day in and day out .
The story was a bestseller .
Then , the world changed overnight .
This one was just as grand .
Paradise on Earth , again .
Those who do not are doomed to fail .
But this time , the Chinese didn &apos;t buy it .
Fool me once ...
The rest is history .
Six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty .
Entrepreneurs are starting companies every day .
Such a system is operationally rigid , politically closed , and morally illegitimate .
Well , the assumptions are wrong .
The opposites are true .
It won &apos;t last long because it cannot adapt .
Now here are the facts .
For example , term limits .
The truth is , political reforms have never stopped .
Now , this may be counterintuitive to you .
It &apos;s serious business .
Once a year , the department reviews their performance .
They conduct public opinion surveys .
Then they promote the winners .
There , they enter high officialdom .
The process takes two to three decades .
Does patronage play a role ? Yes , of course .
But merit remains the fundamental driver .
Now , please don &apos;t get me wrong , okay ?
George W. Bush , remember him ?
This is not a put-down .
I was asked once , &quot; The Party wasn &apos;t voted in by election .
Where is the source of legitimacy ? &quot;
I said , &quot; How about competency ? &quot;
We all know the facts .
Satisfaction with the direction of the country : 85 percent .
Those who expect the future to be better : a whopping 82 percent .
The country faces enormous challenges .
Pollution is one . Food safety . Population issues .
On the political front , the worst problem is corruption .
But most analysts misdiagnose the disease .
Now , I &apos;m a venture capitalist . I make bets .
So here they are .
In the next 10 years , China will surpass the U.S.
and become the largest economy in the world .
We live in the dusk of an era .
Now , I want to clarify something .
I &apos;m not here to make an indictment of democracy .
Let us draw to a close this era of meta-narratives .
It is wrong . It is irresponsible .
And worst of all , it is boring .
Let universality make way for plurality .
Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us .
Are we brave enough to welcome it ?
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thanks .
The Chinese government .
They conduct surveys all the time .
Are you happy with the garbage collection ?
Are you happy with the general direction of the country ?
Many seem to agree .
But it &apos;s different . You wouldn &apos;t recognize it .
Eric , thank you for sharing this with TED . EXL : Thank you .
Hod Lipson : Building &quot; self-aware &quot; robots
So , where are the robots ?
So what can we do about that ? What can we say ?
So let &apos;s try to look at it from a different perspective .
Let &apos;s see what evolution can do for us .
But this machine doesn &apos;t know what it looks like .
So , we &apos;ll move forward to a different idea .
Dee Boersma : Pay attention to penguins
I want to talk about penguins today .
Now there are over 30,000 .
You have to train to be able to do that .
And , more importantly , they &apos;re well-dressed .
And that &apos;s what I came to study .
things die when there &apos;s no food .
They &apos;re not breeding ; they &apos;re not even around .
But this is a global phenomenon , we know that .
There were plenty of them .
So they were just minding their own business .
At first , the Argentine government said , &quot; No , there &apos;s no way .
You can &apos;t find oiled penguins in Argentina .
I &apos;m just going to talk about two things .
The same thing &apos;s true for penguins as well .
This is Turbo the Penguin .
Turbo &apos;s never been fed .
So this is Turbo .
And you can see , he &apos;s not trying to bite .
What is this guy doing ?
This is really pretty weird . &quot;
And now look at this : not friendly .
This is a radio frequency ID system .
Here &apos;s a female that &apos;s in a hurry . She &apos;s got food .
So , they really are pretty amazing creatures .
OK .
So , thank you very much .
I &apos;m the one with the blond hair .
My dad &apos;s the guy with the cigarette .
of being diagnosed with cancer .
There are over 200 kinds of cancer .
Now I &apos;m not a scientist .
So the FDA has a very specific protocol .
And it turns out , that &apos;s a pretty high hurdle .
If not , then why build it ?
No . No , right ?
Let &apos;s create a giant fund .
It &apos;s almost self-funding .
We spent the next two years doing research .
We talked to people who have developed drugs .
We talked to pharmaceutical companies .
And all that actually took a lot of time .
We wanted people to get involved .
That &apos;s a hundred thousand billion .
There &apos;s plenty of money .
What are all the challenges to doing this that might get in the way ?
The conference was held over the summer , this past summer .
It was an invitation-only conference .
So I &apos;d like to think it was a good sign .
I can &apos;t build a drug .
Thank you .
Jessica Jackley : Poverty , money -- and love
This is what Jesus asked of us .
Now I was pretty psyched .
And I felt overwhelmed .
I heard about disease , I heard about war -- they always seemed to be kind of related .
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that .
And so naturally , I started to distance myself .
I mean who can argue with that ?
It was an amazing sort of insight for me .
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .
Their business trajectory would change .
They might be able to buy mosquito nets .
That was another thing that really touched me .
So I saw that and it was very humbling .
In fact , no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all .
The money came in basically overnight .
We sent it over to Uganda .
We said , &quot; Our little experiment has been a success .
The second year , it was a total of 15 million .
The third year , the total was up to around 40 .
The fourth year , we were just short of 100 .
So that &apos;s where Kiva is today , just to bring you right up to the present .
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines .
Now for me , Kiva is just the beginning .
The first one is , as I mentioned , entrepreneurship was a new idea to me .
So they &apos;re not a donation .
Yeah , maybe it doesn &apos;t sound that much different .
But there &apos;s always a need for resources close by .
That &apos;s around 130 billion dollars a year -- it &apos;s a lot .
it actually flows with the up and down .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m working on now .
I think we all already know that .
Just a sec .
Thanks .
Thanks .
Thank you .
Rick Warren : A life of purpose
And I said , that I got to write it .
Just existing .
I really think that &apos;s there &apos;s this inner desire .
I don &apos;t think there are accidental kids .
And I think you matter .
Why do I feel like a fake ?
I &apos;m going , OK , you know . Fine .
Um .
Good for you .
And that was : what is the purpose of this ?
Because it brought in enormous amounts of money .
When I started Saddleback Church , I was 25 years old .
Everybody &apos;s betting their life on something .
I just don &apos;t believe that .
That &apos;s kind of a no-brainer .
So , what is it for ?
So I believe , essentially , that leadership is stewardship .
And he said , &quot; No . &quot;
And he said , &quot; No .
Not any more than any other species . &quot;
You &apos;re not a duck .
But you may , you may .
It determines , really , everything in your life .
I don &apos;t own a guesthouse .
It makes a difference what you believe .
But that &apos;s not the good life .
It &apos;s just not true .
Giving your life away .
It doesn &apos;t come from sex .
It doesn &apos;t come from salary .
It comes from serving .
That , actually , was the easy part .
Because I start getting all kinds of invitations .
And being a pastor , I started reading the Bible .
That &apos;s what he prays .
He says , &quot; I want you to make me famous .
I want you to give me power .
I want you to make me famous .
I want you to give me influence . &quot;
They &apos;re not on my radar .
What &apos;s in your hand ?
Moses says , &quot; It &apos;s a staff .
It &apos;s a shepherd &apos;s staff . &quot;
And God says , &quot; Throw it down . &quot;
And then God says , &quot; Pick it up . &quot;
It &apos;s not just , &quot; Wow , isn &apos;t that cool ? &quot;
So , He &apos;s going , &quot; What &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
Now , what was in Moses &apos; hand ?
First , it represented his identity .
Your assets are tied up in your flocks .
And the third thing : it &apos;s a symbol of his influence .
What do you do with a shepherd &apos;s staff ?
What &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
You &apos;re making a lot of money off that little ball .
And it represents your influence .
What do you have that you &apos;ve been given ?
That , to me , is the primary question about life .
These things shape you .
If you &apos;re wired to make deals , you make deals .
If you &apos;re wired to paint , you paint .
That &apos;s my girl .
It &apos;s about making the world a better place . &quot;
Thank you .
Stefan Wolff : The path to ending ethnic conflicts
But let &apos;s start at the beginning .
So are these now the images of the past ?
But this trend is less unambiguous .
This is a decrease by two-thirds .
This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed .
And the big question , of course , is why ?
But let &apos;s look at the good news again .
Take the example of Northern Ireland .
By no means .
A final example : Kosovo .
First , leadership .
Second , diplomacy .
Third , institutional design .
Thank you .
Rachel Armstrong : Architecture that repairs itself ?
They &apos;re made using Victorian technologies .
All of this effort results in an inert object .
This is not sustainable .
That means we &apos;re generating them from scratch .
And it has no DNA .
It is able to move around its environment .
It can follow chemical gradients .
We don &apos;t know how they do that yet .
This is a violent process .
That can &apos;t be energetically sensible .
So , bottom-up materials actually exist today .
And then they are fossilized over millions of years .
It looks beautiful .
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide .
Well , most likely it would . It might be able to grow .
They think big . Okay ?
So , here is the technology we have today .
Now , this is the very interesting part .
We &apos;ve observed this in the laboratory .
The protocells can actually move away from the light .
Thank you .
Dave Meslin : The antidote to apathy
How often do we hear that people just don &apos;t care ?
Let &apos;s start with city hall .
This is a newspaper ad .
As you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read .
Now that would never happen .
Public space .
This is the cover story .
Heroes : How do we view leadership ?
Anyone ?
But most importantly , it &apos;s voluntary .
It &apos;s voluntary .
Political parties : oh boy .
It &apos;s like trying to run into a brick wall .
We can open up city hall .
We can reform our electoral systems .
We can democratize our public spaces .
Thank you .
Tali Sharot : The optimism bias
Take marriage for example .
In the Western world , divorce rates are about 40 percent .
This , by the way , is my two-year-old nephew , Guy .
And I &apos;m not alone .
That &apos;s 75 percent .
Now I &apos;m a scientist , I do experiments .
The first one is getting along well with others .
Okay , that &apos;s about 10 people out of 1,500 .
Who believes they &apos;re at the top 25 percent ?
That &apos;s most of us here .
Okay , now do the same for your driving ability .
How interesting are you ?
How attractive are you ?
How honest are you ?
And finally , how modest are you ?
Now this is statistically impossible .
And it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
It &apos;s quite widespread .
So some people say no .
Some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations .
Next time they will do better .
People with low expectations do the opposite .
Next time reality would catch up with them .
So they felt worse .
They were willing to pay extra in order to wait .
But three days seemed to be the optimum amount .
So why is that ?
Anticipation made them happy .
And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing .
They &apos;re actually more realistic than healthy individuals .
So optimism changes subjective reality .
But it also changes objective reality .
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy .
But this is not what we find .
So , for example , what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer ?
So cancer , for example , is about 30 percent .
So they learned quickly and efficiently .
But they didn &apos;t think that those numbers were related to them .
It looks like this .
And here &apos;s the thing : it wasn &apos;t doing a very good job .
And there &apos;s a way for us to do that .
This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai .
So let &apos;s see what happens .
The key here really is knowledge .
These have to be identified by scientific investigation .
Thank you .
You just need to look at them a little differently .
Not much has changed in those 50 years .
In this case , it &apos;s expected that you shelter in place .
It &apos;s not great for parents with kids .
It &apos;s probably not good for the fire hydrants .
Certainly not good for the police department .
It was dangerous , hard to cross the street .
It was chaotic .
And so we did a six-month pilot .
So it was all about the data .
But the results were overwhelming .
Traffic moved better . It was much safer .
Five new flagship stores opened .
It &apos;s been a total home run .
They weren &apos;t there before , and then zzzzzt !
All the people arrived .
And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town .
It was about those lawn chairs .
&quot; What did you think about the lawn chairs ? &quot;
&quot; Do you like the color of the lawn chairs ? &quot;
And the proof is not in a computer model .
It is in the real-world performance of the street .
You can have fun with paint .
You can see the map in 2007 .
I love this because it looks so easy .
You just click it , and they &apos;re there .
We also brought new designs to the street .
Bike volumes have spiked .
And you can see here that this strategy has worked .
The green line is the number of bike lanes .
And this is what we had done .
Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes .
People have ridden seven million miles .
That &apos;s 280 times around the globe .
And daily usage just continues to soar .
The high that we &apos;ve had so far is 44,000 in August .
The bikes are being used six times a day .
Quite radical .
You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus .
It was just fantastic .
And this is how it looked six years ago .
You just need to reimagine your streets .
They &apos;re hidden in plain sight .
Thank you .
Elizabeth Loftus : The fiction of memory
Titus was a restaurant manager .
She said , &quot; That one &apos;s the closest . &quot;
And Titus was convicted .
What would you do ?
It should have been over .
It didn &apos;t end that way .
Titus was so bitter .
He &apos;d lost his job . He couldn &apos;t get it back .
He lost his fiancée .
Well , Titus was consumed with his civil case .
He was 35 years old .
I study false memories .
Well , why ?
Our memories are constructive .
They &apos;re reconstructive .
You were frightened . You were crying .
And should we ever ban its use ?
&quot; There she goes . She &apos;s advocating that parents lie to their children . &quot;
Hello , Santa Claus .
And I appreciate that . I feel that way too .
We need independent corroboration .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks very much .
Bruno Bowden + Rufus Cappadocia : Blindfold origami and cello
Hello everyone .
Are you ready to go ? OK .
Just to make it a little bit more exciting .
All right . Take it away , Rufus .
All right . There you go .
Bahia Shehab : A thousand times no
So I decided to look for a thousand different noes .
And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo .
So I &apos;ll be sharing some of these noes with you .
Now , I want to leave you with a final no .
Thank you .
Thank you . Shukran .
Fabian Hemmert : The shape-shifting future of the mobile phone
On the other hand , we humans , we live in a physical world .
It &apos;s rich , it tastes good , it feels good , it smells good .
That &apos;s my question .
The question is : what &apos;s next ?
The first one is mass .
So , could we use that in mobile phones ?
We shift the gravitational center of it .
Now , mass is the first thing ; the second thing , that &apos;s shape .
We can play with the shape itself .
It &apos;s like tapered to the downside .
It &apos;s fairly simple .
You can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
The shape is the second thing .
The third thing operates on a different level .
Think of a hamster in the pocket .
How do we calm it down ?
Nicholas Christakis : The hidden influence of social networks
And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother .
Why are we embedded in social networks ?
I mean , how do they form ? How do they operate ?
And how do they effect us ?
It had become trendy to speak about the &quot; obesity epidemic . &quot;
So this is a slide of some of our initial results .
It &apos;s 2,200 people in the year 2000 .
But the visual complexity is still very high .
It &apos;s not obvious exactly what &apos;s going on .
Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone ?
How big are the clusters ? How far do they reach ?
Well , what might be causing this clustering ?
Blame your fat friends . &quot;
So , again , every dot is a person .
Every tie between them is a relationship .
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena .
And , eventually , we became interested in emotions .
Now , when we have emotions , we show them .
Why do we show our emotions ?
But we don &apos;t just experience them , we show them .
And , not only can they read them , but they copy them .
And , in fact , emotional contagion can be broader still .
Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger , as in riots .
But they never look like this .
Why do they not look like this ?
But that &apos;s not the case with real networks .
And now I &apos;m highlighting a few dots .
And so , those two individuals have different numbers of friends .
That &apos;s very obvious , we all know that .
This is known as transitivity in networks .
they would say , &quot; I &apos;ve got six friends .
That &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
Would you rather be C or D ?
You &apos;d rather be D , on the edge of the network .
Now , you would rather be C.
How does this help us understand ?
They are a kind of social capital .
So think about these two common objects .
Now , look at this .
Thank you .
Anas Aremeyaw Anas : How I named , shamed and jailed
My journey started 14 years ago .
Then I got a scoop .
The scoop was quite a very simple story .
As part of selling , I was able to document the hard core evidence .
The impact was great .
It was fantastic .
This was what many call immersion journalism , or undercover journalism .
I am an undercover journalist .
Journalism is about results .
They got themselves ready .
I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction .
As I speak now , they are before the courts .
It was time to go undercover again .
Again , a prosthetic arm was built .
My journalism is about hard core evidence .
So with my hidden intention , I kept quiet .
I didn &apos;t utter a word .
But my colleagues didn &apos;t know .
Second official : I don &apos;t even know the place called &#91; unclear &#93; .
I &apos;ve never stepped there before .
So I &apos;m surprised .
You see a hand counting money just in front of me .
I have not done any business with anybody .
And here was him , denying .
Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come .
AA That was my president .
I have been undercover in the prisons .
I have been there for a long time .
How can you obtain the hard core evidence ?
Toilet facilities : very bad .
Of course , drugs were abundant .
Evil in the society is an extreme disease .
Show me the evidence . &quot;
I say , &quot; This is the evidence . &quot;
This will not stop .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
I have some questions for you .
AA Yes , yes .
How do you do that ?
AA You see , undercover is always a last resort .
Before we go undercover , we follow the rules .
I mean , everybody has their hazard .
AA Thank you .
Thank you . Stay safe .
Gabriel Barcia-Colombo : Capturing memories in video art
I love to collect things .
Some people reacted in terror .
You may never experience the entire thing yourself .
But I &apos;d never done anything about myself .
I &apos;d never really memorialized myself .
From a teenager , I &apos;m transformed into my current self .
So , in doing so , you &apos;re erasing time .
Thank you .
Josette Sheeran : Ending hunger now
One out of every seven people .
Why should we care ?
Others think about Malthusian nightmares .
This is not a negotiable thing , hunger .
People have to eat .
There &apos;s going to be a lot of people .
We know how to fix hunger .
A hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t .
We actually have the technology and systems .
And I was just struck that this is out of place .
Well guess what ?
This is last week in northern Kenya .
Their brains and bodies will be stunted .
In Mauritania , less than three percent .
This is something that can be transformed with knowledge .
And this is climate-proof .
The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding .
Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .
But when that food is there , it &apos;s transformative .
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls .
Families need the help .
We know that there &apos;s boom and bust cycles of hunger .
We know this .
Absolutely not .
So add in five percent , 10 percent more food .
And the food banks are growing .
Food is gold there .
Food can be there and people can &apos;t buy it .
It says &quot; bon appetit &quot; in Arabic .
The shopkeepers are hiring more people .
And guess what ?
We have to stand together .
What I would like to offer here is a challenge .
No more are we going to accept this . &quot;
Thank you .
My name &apos;s Jamie Oliver . I &apos;m 34 years old .
I use information , education .
We have an awful , awful reality right now .
Please put your hands up .
Most of you . OK .
Right ?
The statistics of bad health are clear , very clear .
Right ?
This is a global problem .
It &apos;s a catastrophe .
It &apos;s sweeping the world .
We need a revolution .
Think about smoking .
It costs way less than obesity now .
We need it . The time is now .
We &apos;re in a tipping-point moment .
I &apos;ve been doing this for seven years .
I &apos;ve been trying in America for seven years .
Now is the time when it &apos;s ripe -- ripe for the picking .
I went to the eye of the storm .
Or it was last year .
Huntington , West Virginia .
Beautiful town .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She has six years to live .
She &apos;s eating her liver to death .
Stacy , the Edwards family .
The family &apos;s obese .
Justin here , 12 years old , he &apos;s 350 pounds .
He gets bullied , for God &apos;s sake .
The daughter there , Katie , she &apos;s four years old .
He has to bury the people , OK ?
Come winter , three times as many people die .
He &apos;s sick of it .
By the way , this is what they get buried in .
We &apos;re not geared up to do this .
OK , I see it as a triangle , OK ?
This is our landscape of food .
I need you to understand it .
Let &apos;s be frank and honest : Well , modern-day life .
Let &apos;s start with the Main Street .
Supermarkets as well .
Big companies . Big companies .
Portion size is obviously a massive , massive problem .
Labeling is a massive problem .
The labeling in this country is a disgrace .
The industry wants to self-police themselves .
Home .
That ain &apos;t happening anymore .
Jamie Oliver : Let &apos;s have a talk .
How are you feeling ?
Stacy : Just feeling really sad and depressed right now .
But I &apos;m killing them .
JO : Yes you are . You are .
But we can stop that .
OK , school .
OK ?
I &apos;m not slagging them off .
They &apos;re doing the best they can do .
They &apos;re doing their best .
Knives and forks ? No , they &apos;re too dangerous .
We &apos;re not teaching our kids .
We don &apos;t teach kids about food . Right ?
Who knows what this is ?
Do you know what that is ?
Do you know what that is ? Broccoli ?
Do you know what this is , honey ? Celery .
Every kid has the right to milk at school .
They &apos;ll be having two bottles . OK ?
And most kids do .
But milk ain &apos;t good enough anymore .
And obviously now that &apos;s going to catch on .
Do you know what I mean ?
For me , there ain &apos;t no need to flavor the milk .
Okay ? There &apos;s sugar in everything .
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients .
There &apos;s our milk . There &apos;s our carton .
So , let me just show you .
There &apos;s your month .
That &apos;s the good news .
It &apos;s very , very preventable .
So , supermarkets .
Week in , week out .
This is not expensive .
I know , easier said than done .
It &apos;s the future . It &apos;s the only way .
I know how they do it .
OK , school .
Life skills .
If you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
Definitely they shouldn &apos;t be left out .
Let &apos;s go back to the home .
Absolutely .
We &apos;ve got to put back what &apos;s been lost .
I truly believe that change will happen .
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month . Okay ?
This is real , tangible change , real , tangible change .
It &apos;s incredibly important .
I &apos;m here .
So , my wish .
Dyslexic , so I &apos;m a bit slow .
Thank you .
So what happens ?
I step on the brake .
But no , this guy isn &apos;t slowing down .
It was just going 65 -- to zero ?
I slammed on the brakes .
You can &apos;t really directly sense the world around you .
You &apos;re in this extended body .
Take your eyes off the road . That &apos;s right .
What &apos;s more important ?
But occasionally we miss something .
In countless accidents , the driver says , &quot; I didn &apos;t see it coming . &quot;
And I believe that . I believe that .
We can only watch so much .
But the technology exists now that can help us improve that .
If that guy &apos;s going down to zero , I &apos;ll know .
You may think that &apos;s impossible .
They travel down roads .
Often they travel on pre-published routes .
That guy &apos;s been on the road probably for the last half hour .
I mean , they &apos;re Newtonian objects .
That &apos;s very nice about them .
So how do we get there ?
And same with the other cars .
I can tell you exactly what happens .
Both models improve .
Everybody wins .
That guy could be a problem .
And you can predict the new trajectory .
And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone ?
Fundamentally , these technologies exist today .
And I think it &apos;s going to be a great thing .
So let your car gossip about you .
It &apos;s going to make the roads a lot safer .
Thank you .
Tim Harford : Trial , error and the God complex
It &apos;s the Second World War .
A German prison camp .
And people do terrible things in wars .
He said he heard suspicious laughter .
So the situation seemed pretty desperate .
It looks like crude oil .
It tastes ...
zesty .
He gives half of them vitamin C.
He gives half of them vitamin B12 .
And he had a name for it .
He called it the God complex .
I see it in our business leaders .
Well let me give you an example .
You know Hans : the Mick Jagger of TED .
And they are brilliant ; it &apos;s wonderful work .
So three pieces of data for each country -- three pieces of data .
Three pieces of data is nothing .
This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo .
He &apos;s at MIT .
And it &apos;s wonderful , wonderful work .
Brilliant work .
Five thousand products -- that &apos;s still nothing .
Imagine you had one second per product category .
There are 100,000 there . It would take you all day .
I &apos;m not trying to solve the Middle East problem .
The complexity here is unbelievable .
You could count them in five minutes .
And we don &apos;t .
We never do .
We clearly can .
And we have a problem-solving technique that works .
Here &apos;s an example .
This baby was produced through trial and error .
I realize that &apos;s an ambiguous statement .
Maybe I should clarify it .
This baby is a human body : it evolved .
What is evolution ?
You could use it in an industrial context .
So let &apos;s say you wanted to make detergent .
How do you do it ?
You create a spray of detergent .
It falls to the floor .
You sell it at a supermarket .
You make lots of money .
How do you design that nozzle ?
It turns out to be very important .
Even this problem , too complicated .
You try out all 10 . You keep the one that works best .
You see how this works , right ?
It looks a bit like a chess piece -- functions absolutely brilliantly .
That is a huge failure rate .
Ten percent of Americans don &apos;t disappear every year .
I sometimes wonder .
It &apos;s come through trial and error .
Obviously trial and error is very important .
Obviously experimentation is very important .
So I say , okay , fine .
You think it &apos;s obvious ?
I want to fix our education system .
I have half a dozen ideas .
We &apos;re going to test them out . They &apos;ll probably all fail .
Then we &apos;ll test some other ideas out .
It &apos;s so uncomfortable .
They had the God complex in spades .
He ran his trial .
They &apos;re not statistically significant .
But we have something .
And it turns out that you &apos;re right and I &apos;m wrong .
They should be in hospital . &quot;
Shut it down at once . &quot;
And there &apos;s this huge hubbub .
Archie lets it die down .
Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room .
But Cochrane would do that kind of thing .
I do not want to have my opinions challenged .
I do not want to have my conclusions tested . &quot;
And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that .
It isn &apos;t easy .
It &apos;s incredibly painful .
You prove one , you prove the other .
But it was always a conjecture .
He made a lot of mistakes .
Thank you .
And I would like to say that life was totally easy with them .
But they loved the hell out of me . They loved me so much .
He ran and worked in a factory .
My grandmother was a homemaker .
When I was in the third grade , a monumental event happened .
An author visited our school , Jack Gantos .
And he wandered away .
Two words that made a colossal difference in my life .
Yeah .
My book had a title page .
My favorite page is the &quot; About the author &quot; page .
And so these characters would become my friends .
I had art .
And I was so thrilled .
Don &apos;t tempt me , because I will do it .
And I just flourished here .
I just couldn &apos;t wait to get to that classroom every day .
So how did I make friends ?
Mr. Greenwood was not pleased .
My grandfather &apos;s just going to kill me . &quot;
And so I took this picture , and I handed it to him .
Just stop drawing in my class . &quot;
So my parents never found out about it .
And a video camera .
I just wanted a video camera .
And I kept making comics .
The kid had no patience for him .
I set up a studio and I tried to get published .
And he said , &quot; Well , who pays you for that ? &quot;
But I know it &apos;s going to happen . &quot;
And I sent out one last batch of postcards .
&quot; Dear Jarrett , I received your postcard .
So the next week I &quot; happened &quot; to be in New York .
And my local paper celebrated the news .
The local bookstore made a big deal of it .
They sold out of all of their books .
My grandparents , they were in the middle of it .
They were so happy . They couldn &apos;t have been more proud .
You know ? You only get one birthday per year .
And for him , it &apos;s only his second .
I have 10 picture books out .
&quot; Punk Farm , &quot; &quot; Baghead , &quot; &quot; Ollie the Purple Elephant . &quot;
And I meet Bagheads .
Lunch ladies treat me really well .
I said , &quot; Mrs. Alisch , how are you ? &quot;
And she responded with , &quot; I &apos;m here . &quot;
Thank you .
And Brian &apos;s shoulders sank .
And I wonder how often that happens .
So we see a lot of this .
And they &apos;re just so uncomfortable .
But we know that &apos;s not true .
So I &apos;ve been looking at this fear of judgment that we have .
If you don &apos;t say the right creative thing , you &apos;re going to be judged .
Bandura &apos;s 86 and he still works at Stanford .
And he &apos;s just a lovely guy .
And it was really enjoyable , really interesting .
And he &apos;d get them comfortable with that .
In fact , everything was better than fine .
And they were holding it in their laps .
Bandura calls this process &quot; guided mastery . &quot;
I love that term : guided mastery .
They just gained a new confidence .
That transformation is amazing .
We see it at the d.school all the time .
To me , that journey looks like Doug Dietz .
Doug Dietz is a technical person .
He designs medical imaging equipment , large medical imaging equipment .
He &apos;s worked for GE , and he &apos;s had a fantastic career .
But at one point he had a moment of crisis .
He would redesign the entire experience of being scanned .
And this is what he came up with .
And now when the kid comes , it &apos;s an experience .
And the results were super dramatic .
And the hospital and GE were happy too .
So the quantitative results were great .
But Doug &apos;s results that he cared about were much more qualitative .
Doug &apos;s story takes place in a hospital .
I know a thing or two about hospitals .
It was cancer . It was the bad kind .
I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival .
But you think about other things .
And I was lucky because I had lots of options .
And so there were lots of projects that I could work on .
I survived , just so you know .
And they just make better decisions .
Everybody has a change-the-world thing .
Thank you .
Julia Sweeney : It &apos;s time for &quot; The Talk &quot;
I have a daughter , Mulan .
And then they become tadpoles and frogs . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she goes , &quot; And what &apos;s this fertilizing ? &quot;
And I thought , &quot; Okay , here we go . &quot;
Don &apos;t give any more information . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , funny you should ask .
We have evolved to have our own pond .
We have our very own pond inside our bodies .
And she goes , &quot; Then how do they get fertilized ? &quot;
And you go through the woman &apos;s vagina . &quot;
Like , where you go to the bathroom ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I know .
I know . &quot;
That &apos;s how we evolved . It does seem odd .
Bad zoning , but ... &quot;
So how could that ever happen ? &quot;
And then I go , &quot; Well , &quot; and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on .
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I said , &quot; ... &quot;
Like , how do they know that &apos;s the time ?
&quot; That is exactly right .
That &apos;s exactly how it happens . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh , no . Humans are so private .
Oh ... &quot;
Would that ever happen ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh , no , no .
That &apos;s not how we do it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand the legs . &quot;
She goes , &quot; Mom , everyone can &apos;t do the splits . &quot;
And I go , &quot; I know , but the legs ... &quot;
and I &apos;m probably like , &quot; The legs get worked out . &quot;
And she goes , &quot; But I just can &apos;t understand it . &quot;
She goes , &quot; What about dogs ? &quot;
That would never happen . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . I &apos;m so happy to be here .
And there &apos;s some evidence that they are .
So the businesses are getting out their checkbooks .
It was written by an algorithm .
And it &apos;s not decent , it &apos;s perfect .
They haven &apos;t done a darn thing to the curves .
Let me give you a couple examples .
And I want to say to that very clearly : nonsense .
The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology .
Thanks very much .
Kelli Swazey : Life that doesn &apos;t end with death
These are called tau tau .
And it &apos;s also a moment of self-awareness .
It &apos;s called the sunga &apos; .
And his death will be greatly mourned .
His story is their story .
Lisa Gansky : The future of business is the &quot; mesh &quot;
And we come from a long tradition of sharing .
We &apos;ve shared transportation .
Secondly , population growth and density into cities .
More people , smaller spaces , less stuff .
For example , I want to use Zipcar .
Wow , that &apos;s great . Okay , thank you .
They did not invent car-sharing .
Zipcar got some really important things right .
They made it sexy . They made it fresh .
They made it aspirational .
They picked these sexy cars .
They targeted to universities .
What percentage of the time ?
Any guesses ?
Those are really very good .
I was imagining it was like 20 percent when I first started .
The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent .
Zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
So , really interesting .
So it &apos;s like vacation rentals for cars .
Because it just creates more flexibility .
It allows us as owners to have other options .
Platforms are invitations .
And honestly , it &apos;s full of surprises .
Google has made available transit data API .
That space is not vital .
And this is a very mesh-y thing .
So this is an example .
It &apos;s very cost-effective , and it &apos;s very mesh-y .
The infrastructure enables that .
They made a lot of mistakes .
They had some number of big successes .
And it grows on a very regular daily basis .
But it &apos;s very much at the beginning .
And thank you very much .
Shaffi Mather : A new way to fight corruption
Corruption , bribes , and lack of transparency .
or , &quot; Let me see who I can corrupt today . &quot;
Now , let me ask you another question .
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption ?
Most definitely you don &apos;t want to pay the bribe .
Such a service simply do not exist .
The target market is as tempting as it can get .
And it is an absolutely virgin market .
It never has been and it never will be .
What gives us the courage ?
Shaffi , that is a really exciting business idea .
What &apos;s on your mind ?
Somebody who had applied for the passport .
And he did not want to pay .
And he will push us back .
So , it actually works .
I mean , this could be huge .
Iwan Baan : Ingenious homes in unexpected places
In the lobby , they painted the walls and planted trees .
They also made a basketball court .
And you even find a church .
In Makoko , very few systems and infrastructures exist .
These dwellings are called the yaodongs .
Thank you .
Ray Zahab : My trek to the South Pole
We shaved five days off the previous best time .
It &apos;s going to be 40 below , every single day .
You &apos;ll be in a massive headwind .
We &apos;d catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled , incidentally .
The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole .
I &apos;m learning this at 40 .
Can you imagine ? Seriously , can you imagine ?
I &apos;m learning this at 40 years of age .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Caroline Lavelle : Casting a spell on the cello
Thank you very much .
Now , I &apos;ve got a story for you .
And I said , &quot; Do you really ? &quot;
I am also joined by my partner in crime , Thomas Dolby .
This song is called &quot; Farther than the Sun . &quot;
Mitch Resnick : Let &apos;s teach kids to code
So I started taking a look at them .
What do I mean by fluent ?
And it &apos;s similar with new technologies .
But actually I &apos;m sort of skeptical about this term .
But that doesn &apos;t really make you fluent .
It seems that everybody is getting into the act .
And that triggered a debate in the U.K.
about whether all the children there should learn to code .
But coding doesn &apos;t have to be like this .
You can also code to interact with the physical world around you .
Here &apos;s an example .
It uses the webcam .
Again , it &apos;s useful to make an analogy to reading and writing .
And it &apos;s the same thing with coding .
Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious .
You learn more about how computers work .
But that &apos;s just where it starts .
Let me show you an example .
He wanted to keep score .
So I showed him .
I &apos;ll call it score .
And it &apos;s in fact working .
It &apos;s nothing that , really , they can make use of .
They &apos;re relevant for all sorts of different activities .
Again , it &apos;s useful to think about this analogy with language .
Very few people become professional writers .
And it &apos;s not just about your work life .
Let me end with just one more example .
It &apos;s scratch.mit.edu , and give a try at coding .
Thanks very much .
Adora Svitak : What adults can learn from kids
Which really bothers me .
Ask yourself , who &apos;s responsible ? Adults .
Now , what have kids done ?
Thank you .
On the other hand , we kids still dream about perfection .
I think that adults should start learning from kids .
The students should teach their teachers .
True story , by the way .
Thank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma .
Or just like you ? Really ?
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed .
Are you ready to make the match ?
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Let &apos;s see , I &apos;d say about three or four percent .
Okay , that &apos;s the majority .
My Talk today is about self-transcendence .
He collected all kinds of case studies .
The next day I rejoiced with trembling .
This world had no place in my affections .
Some shut down the self using meditation .
Others use psychedelic drugs .
It feels somehow uplifting .
The lower level he called the level of the profane .
Now profane is the opposite of sacred .
It just means ordinary or common .
We want to satisfy our individual desires .
We pursue our individual goals .
So let me summarize where we are .
Well let me show you .
In other words , Charles Darwin believed in group selection .
Within this team there &apos;s competition .
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics .
Let me illustrate this for you .
But suppose then that one of them mutates .
It takes advantage of the others .
The free-riders have taken over .
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
In fact , nature has solved it many , many times .
We are Homo duplex , as Durkheim explained .
Those things came along too recently .
But sometimes we wonder : Is this all there is ?
What should I do with my life ?
What &apos;s missing ?
It &apos;s really comfortable down here on the lower level .
They &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
&quot; No man is an island entire of itself .
JH : Thank you .
Cynthia Kenyon : Experiments that hint of longer lives
This is a dream of the ages .
because they have different genes .
And we didn &apos;t study any of these animals .
It &apos;s quite a cute little fellow .
So this animal is going to live twice as long .
Now get out your handkerchiefs here .
But everything else is just lying there .
And now here is the daf-2 mutant .
This is what &apos;s really cool : it &apos;s aging more slowly .
She says , &quot; I &apos;m 60 . &quot;
Okay .
So what is the daf-2 gene ?
That &apos;s what that arrow means .
So what kind of hormones are these ?
There &apos;s lots of hormones . There &apos;s testosterone , adrenalin .
You know about a lot of them .
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth .
And it &apos;s looking like that &apos;s the case .
And that is the case in flies .
And there are hints of this .
It damaged the gene .
How could that work ?
The receptor isn &apos;t working as well .
And it &apos;s just sitting on one of them .
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes .
And the immune system is more active .
So it &apos;s really interesting .
So what about the normal worm ?
So it can &apos;t turn the genes on .
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients .
But it &apos;s deteriorating .
So he doesn &apos;t actually do anything himself .
And they all come and they fortify the house .
So this is really exciting to me .
There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging .
Now I don &apos;t want you all to go out taking rapamycin .
Thank you .
Matt Ridley : Thank you , Cynthia .
Let me get this straight .
So if you stop taking the drug , the protein would go back to normal .
You could change the genes in principle .
There isn &apos;t the technology to do that .
But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
If you knock them out completely , then you &apos;re very sick .
For example , there are some tortoises called Blanding &apos;s turtles .
And they grow to be about this size .
It &apos;s not clear .
And our long-lived mutants are too .
They &apos;re more resistant to these kinds of stresses .
Yes , that &apos;s right .
It &apos;s more like , say , if you were a dog .
It &apos;s more like that .
MR : Thank you very much indeed , Cynthia Kenyon .
Dan Phillips : Creative houses from reclaimed stuff
Thank you very much .
It was all just gone .
This is the first house I built .
Have a little turret there .
And then these buttons on the corbels here .
Right there -- those are hickory nuts .
Then , this is a look at the inside .
Even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars .
Everything in the kitchen was salvaged .
This is going up into the turret .
If not , it goes into the toilet .
It &apos;s a two-person tub .
Then , this faucet here is just a piece of Osage Orange .
That &apos;ll keep bull elephants out , I promise .
The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer .
And then the faucet , there , is a beer tap .
It &apos;s a pretty panel of glass .
So don &apos;t put it there .
Then , another bathroom upstairs .
Don &apos;t put it in the foyer .
Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass .
What does that mean ?
Oh , that &apos;s a cell phone .
But you &apos;ve never seen this one before .
Oh , that &apos;s a cell phone .
That &apos;s not a cell phone .
That &apos;s how we process information .
We &apos;ll go , &quot; Ooh , that &apos;s nice . &quot;
So , that serves me every day .
Repetition creates pattern .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference .
Predicated on plumb level , square and centered .
The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes ...
That &apos;s the difference .
I feature blemish .
I feature organic process .
Dead-center John Dewey .
Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste .
&quot; Oops , scratch , dumpster . &quot;
By the middle of the 19th century , it &apos;s in full flower .
So now we have standardized materials .
We create mountains of waste .
Well , that &apos;s just a myth .
&quot; Dan , I just don &apos;t think I &apos;m ready . &quot;
&quot; Jim , now it &apos;s time . You &apos;re the down , oh . &quot;
So we hired on .
Do the math . &quot;
And the irony is that he wasn &apos;t very good at math .
And that &apos;s what happened there .
The problem is we can &apos;t afford it .
It &apos;s a chattel mortgage , just like furniture , just like a car .
Wired with 14-gauge wire typically .
Are we just being numbingly stupid ?
The walls are this thick .
The whole thing has the structural value of corn .
&quot; So I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there . &quot;
&quot; No , no . We had a wind last night .
It &apos;s gone now . &quot;
Then when they degrade , what do you do with them ?
Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers .
&quot; Woo . Woohooo . &quot;
We buy stuff we didn &apos;t know we needed .
How disgusting .
My oh my , that makes it worse .
It &apos;s a pretty quick read .
In there he talked about the divided self .
That happens in the building industry as well .
Sometimes those guys are Nazis , my oh my .
That exacerbates and continues this model .
The last thing is gregariousness .
Human beings are a social species .
Human beings are like that .
And so you see this in junior high a lot .
You &apos;re not one of the beautiful people .
Right there is reason enough to have uniforms .
Fourth , status , self-esteem -- that is , vanity .
And we &apos;re taking vanity and shoving it down here .
We can &apos;t even afford to eat anything except beans .
That is , our housing has become a commodity .
But that &apos;s okay .
What a moron . &quot;
What don &apos;t you do this , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
We &apos;re in trouble .
What do you think , honey ? &quot;
If it doesn &apos;t work , take it down .
Thank you very much .
Jay Walker : My library of human imagination
This is not a copy .
They would bring them back and mount them .
So that &apos;s for fun .
The dawn of books is , of course , important .
In 1455 , nobody could read .
So why did the printing press succeed ?
This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible .
But why is this so interesting ? Here &apos;s the quick story .
They got you out of purgatory faster .
We &apos;re going to have some tomorrow .
This is the Library of Human Imagination .
The room itself is three stories tall .
The room is a theatre . It changes colors .
It &apos;s designed like an Escher print .
You can walk through . You can touch .
There &apos;s my very own Saturn V.
Everybody should have one , OK ?
So it &apos;s a leap of imagination .
How do we create ?
TED is all about patterns in the clouds .
It &apos;s all about connections .
For example , we can look at a DNA molecule model here .
These two molecules code and decode .
And they &apos;re connected primarily because of this here .
We get to see a skull . But there it is .
And I &apos;ll give you a quick example .
And we never think about the hidden connection .
Thanks , Chris .
How do we know that ?
Now there is another side to this .
That &apos;s all true .
And so we should .
Guess what ?
Video games are not the cause .
Video games are a symptom .
The first is zero tolerance .
I mean , really .
Now I &apos;m not advocating for bullies .
&quot; Poems . I have to write poems .
And little moments in my life .
I don &apos;t want to write that stuff . &quot;
I want to write about this really interesting world .
&quot; All right . Okay . &quot;
He &apos;s just a little boy .
Now what &apos;s the problem with this ?
Women are great . Yep , absolutely .
This is a place for girls .
&quot; What are we going to do with these boys ? &quot;
Are there men around that table ?
That &apos;s what she tells them .
Indirectly , that &apos;s what she tells them .
It &apos;s coming from us .
Have you seen the ads ?
So what do we do ?
We need to meet them where they are .
More specifically , we can do some very specific things .
We can design better games .
So we need to design better games .
Do they make sense ?
Most of the educational games do not .
And they &apos;re always talking about this stuff . &quot;
It wasn &apos;t for me .
So I &apos;ve got to do gaming , or I &apos;ve got to do sports . &quot;
Thank you .
So we &apos;re based in New York City .
He &apos;s named after the Star Trek character .
I think he &apos;s going to be super popular .
It knows how much it &apos;s moving .
And so it &apos;s going to try to watch your response .
Now don &apos;t be shy .
It &apos;s just a robot .
It doesn &apos;t have feelings ... yet .
Right , so , let the robot stand-up comedy begin .
Data : Hello TEDWomen .
It &apos;s an honor to be here .
You guys are looking good out there .
Ready for some jokes ?
Data : Here &apos;s the first one .
&quot; That &apos;s terrible , &quot; said the patient .
&quot; How can the news possibly be worse ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been trying to contact you since yesterday . &quot;
Heather Knight : He &apos;s talking about the Swiss .
Data : Pretty lucky for them .
HK : He &apos;s a French robot .
One of them falls to the ground .
He does not seem to be breathing .
The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911 .
What can I do ? &quot;
The operator says , &quot; Just take it easy .
I can help .
First , let &apos;s make sure he &apos;s dead . &quot;
Question : Why is television called a medium ?
Anyone ?
Any of you like television ? Audience : Yes .
Data : I find it incredibly educational .
That &apos;s all for now .
Was that okay for my first time ?
You &apos;ve been a great audience .
Thank you .
HK : Yay .
So thank you all for being a part of it .
There &apos;s a lot more to come .
Thank you very much .
TED &apos;s nonprofit transition
The date was February 2000 .
And it was gut wrenching .
The theme next year is re-birth .
It &apos;s connected ; it all hooks into each other .
And she answered , &quot; A penis . &quot;
Are we the victims of a mass delusion ?
And so on , and so on .
Every mental organ addressed . It really is .
So , I will . Here &apos;s the vision for TED .
That &apos;s not going to be changed at all .
It &apos;s true .
I think it will be great .
I &apos;m incredibly excited about that .
Carolyn Porco : Could a Saturn moon harbor life ?
Thank you .
Stefan Sagmeister : 7 rules for making more happiness
The serif is not really in place .
That climate plays no role .
Black people are just as happy as white people are .
If you &apos;re old or young it doesn &apos;t really make a difference .
You will adapt to it and get used to it .
Now this does matter .
We become what we really are interested in .
This is just completely ridiculous . &quot;
So I am looking still for a Stephanie .
I &apos;ll figure something out .
One of them is to think without pressure .
But also because the content was very close .
Thank you so much .
Sean Gourley : The mathematics of war
Can you get me some information ?
No . So I had to think a little harder .
And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice .
And I saw that there was information there .
There was data within the streams of news that we consume .
We did it in three steps .
What would that tell us ?
So we plot data for sample on this .
We did this exact same thing for Iraq .
This blew our mind .
Why should there be order in war ?
We didn &apos;t really understand that .
So we looked at a few more conflicts .
We looked at Colombia , we looked at Afghanistan , and we looked at Senegal .
And the same pattern emerged in each conflict .
This wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
So we went a little wider .
So what ?
How do we explain this ?
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .
We can run these simulations .
So what &apos;s going on ?
What does it look like ?
This is what wars look like when they continue .
We &apos;ve got to change that .
And we see the evolution of Alpha through time .
This is when the surge happens .
The opposite happened .
The groups became stronger .
They became more robust .
It &apos;s moved up again . The groups are more fragmented .
Thank you .
Ryan Merkley : Online video -- annotated , remixed and popped
Popcorn changes all of that .
Let &apos;s set it to something else .
Thank you .
Kiran Sethi : Kids , take charge
Contagious is a good word .
Laughter is contagious . Passion is contagious .
Inspiration is contagious .
So , the question is , why only them ?
Is it luck ? Is it chance ?
And that directly increased student wellbeing .
Children became more competent , and less helpless .
But this was all common sense .
That &apos;s them rolling .
And that can &apos;t happen in a classroom .
Show us the grades . &quot;
And we did . The data was conclusive .
Now it was not about Riverside school .
It was about all children . So , we were shameless .
So , how did the city respond ?
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad .
&#91; Unclear &#93; So , the busiest streets closed down .
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us .
It gets taken over by children .
They are playing , all free , for all children .
Kiran Bir Sethi : And the city will give free time .
It was time now to infect India .
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems .
I mean , it was incredible .
Infection in India .
This is in Rajasthan , a rural village .
Look at what their parents says .
This program is wonderful .
See ? They have done it .
K An inner city school in Hyderabad .
Girl : 581 . This house is 581 ...
We have to start collecting from 555 .
Girl : Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
Are you ready , ladies and gentlemen ? Audience : Yes !
K So , the charter of compassion starts right here .
Street plays , auctions , petitions .
I mean , they were changing lives .
It was incredible .
So , how can we still stay immune ?
So , if not us , then who ?
If not now , then when ?
Thank you .
And now we &apos;ve got the digital revolution .
Never have been .
It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be .
It was a very tragic time . It was a very difficult time .
And Ushahidi means &quot; testimony &quot; or &quot; witness &quot; in Swahili .
This is David and Erik .
I call them brothers from another mother .
I moved back to Kenya in 2011 .
Erik moved in 2010 .
I had never had to deal with a blackout .
Blackouts are not fun .
This is the reality that we deal with .
Could we leverage the cloud ?
We &apos;ve built a crowd map , we &apos;ve built Ushahidi .
This is the BRCK .
Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive .
It &apos;s actually everywhere .
Most towns at least have a 3G connection .
And for rural areas , it can be the primary means of connection .
It is not without challenge .
&quot; What are you carrying ? &quot;
Thank you .
Salman Khan : Let &apos;s use video to reinvent education
Salman Khan : So the hypotenuse is now going to be five .
A galaxy . Hey , there &apos;s another galaxy .
Oh look , there &apos;s another galaxy .
And these are just a few .
And let &apos;s pause here .
This clearly was helping people .
We could not believe it .
He is so excited . &quot;
But I was excited , so I kept going .
It &apos;s good for motivated students .
It &apos;s good for maybe home schoolers . &quot;
Now they &apos;re actually interacting with each other .
The ones I started were much more primitive .
This is a more competent version of it .
And the Khan Academy videos are there .
You can &apos;t quite stop .
Stay on that bicycle . Fall off that bicycle .
Do it as long as necessary until you have mastery .
We encourage you to experiment . We encourage you to failure .
But we do expect mastery .
This is just another one of the modules .
This is trigonometry .
This is shifting and reflecting functions .
And they all fit together .
We have about 90 of these right now .
It &apos;s like one plus one is equal to two .
Every row is a student .
Every column is one of those concepts .
Red means they &apos;re stuck .
and all of the rest .
The inner circle shows the videos they &apos;re focused on .
Red is wrong , blue is right .
They watched the video right over there .
They also got faster .
The height is how long it took them .
Maybe they should be tracked differently .
And we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
And actually , that kind of brings an interesting point .
Now 100 percent of their time is .
But this is all one system .
Thank you .
Tell me what you &apos;re thinking there .
It &apos;s actually been pretty interesting .
SK : Los Altos , it was kind of crazy .
And they &apos;re doing it at the district level .
And we can track everything .
So we made that focus diagram .
So it &apos;s all been teacher-driven .
It &apos;s been pretty crazy .
SK : Yeah , it &apos;s ready .
And the vision of the tutoring thing .
But yeah , it &apos;s all there .
Well , it &apos;s amazing .
Thank you .
Chip Conley : Measuring what makes life worthwhile
Because what we actually count truly counts .
This is Van Quach .
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam .
Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home .
Well , not exactly , of course not .
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed .
I went to Bhutan .
But the king was serious .
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister .
We create the conditions for happiness to occur .
In other words , we create a habitat of happiness . &quot;
Wow , that &apos;s interesting .
How many know him ? Anybody ?
Do we pursue happiness with hostility ?
Good question . But back to Bhutan .
I like it .
Co-branding opportunities .
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting .
Wow .
So how do we do that ?
But all of those questions are tangible .
They &apos;re about demographics .
That &apos;s about it .
We &apos;re not asking meaningful metrics .
We &apos;re not asking important questions .
We &apos;re not asking anything that &apos;s intangible .
We &apos;ve been fooled by our tool .
Excuse that expression .
We &apos;ve been fooled by our tool .
GDP has been our hammer .
I guess I &apos;m sort of a curious CEO .
They aren &apos;t the same .
We count numbers .
We count on people .
What can you start counting today ?
Thank you very much .
Joseph Pine : What consumers want
So , we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy .
Well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commoditized .
Think about meaningful places .
The experience capital in the world of conferences .
All of these are experiences .
And the question isn &apos;t really so much a question as an accusation .
And the Dutch , when they usually put it , it always starts with the same two words .
You Americans .
They say , you Americans .
Why ? Because the experience happens inside of us .
And there &apos;s no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience .
And the Dutch , they always go ...
and they realize , I &apos;m right !
Becoming the basis of the economy .
We &apos;re the agrarian economy , and we &apos;re supplying commodities .
It &apos;s about supply and availability .
Getting the commodities to market .
With the service economy , it is about improving quality .
Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is &quot; rendering . &quot;
Are you rendering authenticity ?
Where , on one dimension it &apos;s a matter of being true to yourself .
The opposite , of course , is -- fake fake .
All right , now , there is value for fake .
But is it really true to itself ?
Right ? Is it really in the city ?
So she calls it a real fake .
But it is -- oh , I &apos;m sorry , I didn &apos;t mean to -- -- sorry .
We won &apos;t talk about Santa Claus then .
But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself .
Right ? Just wonderfully true to itself .
So , it &apos;s a fake real .
So , you have to understand that past .
Think about Disney again .
Because it is no longer true to itself .
For people to experience who you are .
Right , it &apos;s not advertising does it .
Right ? Coffee , at its core , is what ?
Right ? It &apos;s beans ; right ? It &apos;s coffee beans .
So , authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility .
One , don &apos;t say you &apos;re authentic unless you really are authentic .
Thank you .
Sarah Kaminsky : My father the forger
You understand &quot; forged currency , &quot; &quot; forged pictures . &quot;
My father is no such man .
Let me introduce him .
Here is my father at age 19 .
This is me in the middle making faces .
well , he was basically old enough to be my grandfather .
In order to do that , I set out to forge their signature .
She yelled at me like she never had before .
I heard him come in .
Indeed , it &apos;s rather small .
I was born in Algeria .
And indeed , I was very far from the mark .
These are real !
And then , suddenly , I went &quot; wow ! &quot;
My father , a secret agent ?
It was very James Bond .
His parents were of Russian descent .
The whole family came to settle in France in the &apos; 30s .
So at the age of 14 my father had to work .
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching .
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .
Suddenly the man looked very , very interested .
Of course he knew .
But it was only the beginning .
That &apos;s my father .
All the movements stopped at falsifying .
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch .
He started a press . He started photoengraving .
He started making rubber stamps .
If he slept one hour , 30 people would die .
He was broke all of the time .
One day my father introduced me to my sister .
They are both in their sixties now .
He &apos;d say , &quot; I &apos;ll call . &quot; He wouldn &apos;t call .
And then he would not come .
Then one day he totally disappeared .
There was also Latin America .
Then there was the Vietnam War .
Europe was not spared either .
There , just once , it happened in May of 1968 .
He said no .
He &apos;s still dreaming about it .
Thank you .
Well , indeed , I &apos;m very , very lucky .
That match was unambiguous .
And at the time , people actually answered that question positively : &quot; Yes . &quot;
But there was no evidence .
Are we alone ? &quot;
Now , the good news .
It &apos;s a new telescope .
The way we do that , actually , is with a method , which we call the transit method .
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light .
So , what have we learned ?
We do that in our solar system .
And that &apos;s what the frustration was .
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled .
But you see , we haven &apos;t gone very far .
We were still back where Copernicus was .
And we didn &apos;t have the evidence for that .
Most of these are candidates .
In the next few years we will confirm them .
But the statistical result is loud and clear .
So the question is : what do we do next ?
It &apos;s about 100 million such planets .
That &apos;s great news . Why ?
We know and expect that we &apos;ll see that .
That &apos;s great , but that is not the whole news .
That &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .
We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that .
And so , that &apos;s what we are trying to do .
And that &apos;s what many people now are trying to do .
So why should you care about that ?
Am I that charming ?
But there is something more profound here , something deeper .
This pixel is the Earth .
It is the Earth as we know it .
But it &apos;s really tiny .
We know that .
The biosphere is the size of the Earth .
Life on Earth is the size of the Earth .
What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong ?
Let &apos;s actually try that .
So in space , the Earth is very small .
Can you imagine how small it is ?
Let me try it .
It will be the size of a single , small atom .
It is unimaginably small .
We can &apos;t imagine it .
But that &apos;s not the whole story , you see .
This is not insignificant .
This is very significant .
So what does this tell us ?
And let &apos;s do it .
Thank you very much .
Peter Hirshberg : The web is more than &quot; better TV &quot;
Well , good morning .
I wrote on cards : &quot; television , &quot; &quot; radio , &quot; &quot; MySpace , &quot; &quot; Internet , &quot; &quot; PC . &quot;
Peter Hirshberg : Which is more fun , Internet or TV ?
Girls : Internet .
Girl 2 : And then you can download onto your iPod .
PH : Would you like to be the president of a TV network ?
Girl 4 : I wouldn &apos;t like it .
Girl 2 : That would be so stressful .
Girl 5 : No .
PH : How come ?
Girl 5 : Because they &apos;re going to lose all their money eventually .
Girl 3 : Like the stock market , it goes up and down and stuff .
By the way , this is about when I enter the picture .
Doesn &apos;t work out too well for them , they lose money .
Warner , of course , writes off more than 400 million dollars .
Four hundred million dollars , which was real money back in the &apos; 70s .
But they were onto something and they got better at it .
Journalist : It &apos;s a Whirlwind electronic computer .
Jay Forrester : Hello New York , this is Cambridge .
And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer .
Would you like if I used the machine ?
How &apos;s that ?
Journalist : What about that , Admiral ?
CB : Looks very good to me .
Journalist : Thank you very much indeed , Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab .
Enter the atomic bomb .
Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry .
Here &apos;s their marketing video .
And then it would be too late to act .
We cannot afford to take that chance .
This is a really good example of that .
So -- and we haven &apos;t even worked out the cooling needs .
All of this stuff starts moving into industry .
DEC knew a good thing about wasting time .
In fact , despair is in the air .
And they fake it .
Come on into the secret lab .
I assure you , that &apos;s not the case .
And actually , ending the career of a lot of people at CBS .
Here he is talking from the 1960s .
PH : You know , McLuhan talked about the global village .
It &apos;s a sort of Ann Landers &apos; column writ large .
We &apos;re now right into the 1960s .
But all that was about to change .
People were leaving to go back to the land .
There was the Vietnam War . There was black liberation .
There was women &apos;s liberation .
And most importantly , they had this ethos of sharing information .
Feed your head , feed your head , feed your head . &quot;
A prototyping tool ? A scripted language ?
Here &apos;s the Apple marketing video .
That &apos;s like a Dick Cheney speech .
Though some were incredulous ... Man 1 : The phone company !
The medium introduced America to new products .
Be sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work .
In 1939 , the Radio Corporation of America introduced television .
And the forces of convergence exploded .
Finally , four great industrial sectors combined .
Telecommunications , entertainment , computing and everything else .
All of industry was in play , as investors flocked to place their bets .
It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media .
Thomas Edison had the same problem .
It &apos;s a customer , it &apos;s an audience , it &apos;s a person who &apos;s participating .
It &apos;s the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now .
That &apos;s about 2,700 fresh , connective links across about 112 million blogs that are out there .
But it &apos;s not a joke . This is a real headline .
Voices 2 , 3 and 4 : With her ?
Voice 2 : Well , there goes the neighborhood .
We &apos;re in the business of connecting with consumers . &quot;
And media companies realize the audience is important also .
PH : I think it &apos;s a great time of enthrallment .
Thanks very much .
Nadia Al-Sakkaf : Well , I &apos;m glad to be here .
So many people are there .
The intensity of the upspring .
I love this picture .
And expression also , it has brought talents .
Obviously , there &apos;s always the dark side of it .
Is it going to be so many different countries ?
Is it going to be another Somalia ?
Your father is murdered .
But there &apos;s so much potential .
He would say we are equal .
And he was such an extraordinary man .
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family .
A story : I studied in India .
I &apos;m not a Yemeni ; I &apos;m not an Indian . &quot;
And he said , &quot; You are the bridge . &quot;
PM : I don &apos;t think so .
It was very hard at first .
I didn &apos;t want to clash with people .
Brought in more women .
Brought in younger men .
The other thing is that it &apos;s about professionalism .
So that was the answer to all the Yemeni people .
If you could please stand up , &#91; unclear &#93; .
He has been very supportive of me .
And this is true .
And I have done this throughout my work .
I &apos;ve tried to encourage young girls .
And I am a role model in Yemen .
A lot of people look up to me .
A lot of young girls look up to me .
You can be yourself and have your face .
And very , very difficult times .
Some of my reporters were arrested .
We had some court cases .
My father was assassinated .
Today , we are in a much better situation .
We &apos;ve created the credibility .
And that &apos;s not fair .
It &apos;s not fair for me ; it &apos;s not fair for my country .
That thing .
Yeah , break dancing .
I &apos;m not so old .
I &apos;m just not in touch .
PM : Yes , you are .
Actually , that &apos;s a documentary that &apos;s available online ; the video &apos;s online .
N ShaketheDust.org.
PM : &quot; Shake the Dust . &quot;
PM : ShaketheDust.org.
And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen .
You spoke about the responsibility of the press .
So it &apos;s about the lack of research , basically .
It &apos;s natural .
And the very best of luck to you .
YemenTimes.com.
N On Twitter also .
PM : So you are plugged in .
Anthony Atala : Growing new organs
But we have a major shortage of organs .
While , at the same time , the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat .
We &apos;re just getting older .
Medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive .
But as we age , our organs tend to fail more .
These are major issues .
This is actually a very stunning statistic .
So , what can we do about it ?
We &apos;ve talked about stem cells tonight .
That &apos;s a way to do it .
This is actually a picture of a salamander .
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate .
You see here a little video .
You see the scar form .
So , salamanders can do it .
Why can &apos;t we ? Why can &apos;t humans regenerate ?
Actually , we can regenerate .
As you age , as you get older .
Your bones regenerate every 10 years .
Your skin regenerates every two weeks .
So , your body is constantly regenerating .
The challenge occurs when there is an injury .
So , how can we harness that power ?
One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials .
This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body .
And you see that it is injured .
That &apos;s exactly what you see here .
This was an injured urethra on the left side .
We used that biomaterial in the middle .
The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter .
So , we do regenerate , but for limited distances .
Then we can start to use cells .
It disintegrates a few months later .
It &apos;s acting only as a cell delivery vehicle .
And that &apos;s what we did for this piece of muscle .
What about other structures ?
This is actually an engineered blood vessel .
And we can then tubularize this scaffold .
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types .
You place the muscle cells on the outside .
You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside .
You now have your fully seeded scaffold .
You &apos;re going to place this in an oven-like device .
You then exercise it , as what you saw on that tape .
This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain .
But they are really acting mostly as conduits .
You &apos;re allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states .
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs .
So , the bladder is one such organ .
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells .
We coat the outside with these muscle cells .
We place it back into this oven-like device .
This actually shows the scaffold .
The material is actually being coated with the cells .
It &apos;s true .
This is actually a heart valve , which we engineered .
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy .
We exercise these prior to implantation .
Same strategy .
And then the most complex are the solid organs .
This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear .
It &apos;s now being seeded with cartilage .
This is actually digits that we &apos;re engineering .
We then start adding the muscle on top .
And you start layering these solid structures .
This is actually your typical desktop printer .
You can see , actually that &apos;s a fluoroscopy .
We &apos;re actually injecting contrast into the organ .
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact .
We perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient &apos;s own liver cells .
And that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing .
They are actually making urine .
Why ? Because they will not reject .
Why ? Because we &apos;d rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want .
A windpipe cell already knows it &apos;s a windpipe cell .
We don &apos;t need to teach it to become another cell type .
So , we prefer organ-specific cells .
And for those we still need stem cells .
So , these are very tough technologies .
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it .
So , I always like to show this cartoon .
This is how to stop a runaway stage .
He finally stops the runaway stage .
But actually method A is the correct approach .
we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question .
I &apos;m going to show a clip of one young lady .
She had a spina bifida defect , a spinal cord abnormality .
We are just taking five seconds .
And that is really very simple , to make our patients better .
Thank you for your attention .
Probably not , but people like me do .
But this is only one half of the story .
And first of all , what do we even study ?
Many of you may know it by the term tartar .
And so previous studies had only focused on microscopy .
And we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut .
Thank you .
Molly Crockett : Beware neuro-bunk
How do I know ? I &apos;m the scientist who did the study .
So we did an experiment .
This is the amino acid tryptophan .
Cheese ? Chocolate ? Where did that come from ?
But nevertheless , neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing .
I have to say , this sounds awesome .
I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
But I didn &apos;t find any .
And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties .
Really cool stuff .
The headline ? &quot; You Love Your iPhone . Literally . &quot;
So how &apos;d they figure this out ?
No , it &apos;s a hormone called oxytocin .
You &apos;ve probably heard of it .
So he &apos;s calling oxytocin &quot; the moral molecule . &quot;
And in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
We see it in supermarkets , on book covers .
What about the clinic ?
This sounds great . A lot of people agree .
But we &apos;re not there yet .
So here &apos;s where you come in .
Ask the tough questions . Ask to see the evidence .
Ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not being told .
The answers shouldn &apos;t be simple , because the brain isn &apos;t simple .
But that &apos;s not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway .
Thank you .
Steven Schwaitzberg : A universal translator for surgeons
Now , nobody wants an operation .
Who here has had surgery ?
Did you want it ?
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation .
Nobody wants an operation .
So let &apos;s see what it looks like .
So this is gallbladder surgery .
This is the real thing . There &apos;s no blood .
You can see it in their faces .
Let me tell you , surgeons are not born .
Surgeons are not made either .
It starts with a foundation , basic skills .
Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training .
It &apos;s hard .
We can &apos;t travel everywhere .
We need to make the world a smaller place .
So I was inspired by a friend .
This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto .
Very inspiring .
I work at the Cambridge Hospital .
It &apos;s the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility .
It &apos;s a big labor-intensive effort .
And there isn &apos;t always a translator available .
So we need tools .
We need a universal translator .
It &apos;s really about setting up a dialogue .
We have a lot to learn .
And it has to be bi-directional .
It &apos;s a big task .
A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain .
I need to have a health care lexicon .
And in that I need a surgery lexicon .
This is research -- can &apos;t buy it .
We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic .
We work with a fourth technology .
And we currently have access to eleven language pairs .
Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery .
Module five : manual skills practice .
Students may display captions in their native language .
But that &apos;s the lectures .
This is how you hold the needle .
Grab the needle at the tip .
It &apos;s important to be accurate .
Aim for the black dots .
Orient your loop this way .
Now go ahead and cut .
We want it to be bi-directional .
We have a need to learn as well as to teach .
This is a ubiquitous tool .
Thank you very much .
Hans Rosling : New insights on poverty
I told you three things last year .
And if I could share the image with you on the screen .
So three things have happened .
The bubbles are the countries .
At that time there was a &quot; we &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
There was a huge difference in the world .
But then it changed , and it went on quite well .
And this is what happens .
You can see how China is the red , big bubble .
The blue there is India .
And I will talk on , is this possible ?
Because this is where we are .
Will it be possible that this will happen ?
I expect to live 100 years .
And this is where we are today .
And I would like to show that against child survival .
We &apos;ll swap the axis .
And this is GDP per capita on this axis .
And this was 2007 .
Some countries still had statistics .
You see the importance of that ?
And here , children don &apos;t live longer .
It moves this way over here .
Let us have a look at the United States .
They are on the money side all the time .
And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today .
Chile &apos;s catching up !
And behind the health is the educational level .
And I want to look at Sweden and the United States .
And here we go . Here we go .
And the Volvo is doing quite fine .
They really caught up .
And this changes gradually .
And this is my family .
Sweden was like Sierra Leone today .
And this is when great-grandma was born , 1863 .
And Sweden was like Mozambique .
And this is when my grandma was born , 1891 .
Sweden was like Ghana .
I &apos;m the Mexican in the family .
But they &apos;re very small , you know ?
But homage to Singapore .
Singapore is the best one .
Now this looks also like a very good story .
Carbon-dioxide emission , metric ton per capita .
And what happens when we moved on ?
There is no one who has done it so far .
And there we are , 2001 .
&quot; But we forgive you , because you didn &apos;t know it .
But from now on , we count per capita .
From now on we count per capita .
And this is really what has to be changed .
The world is quite a messy place .
This we can call Dollar Street .
Everyone lives on this street here .
This family earns about one dollar per day .
And how do they live ?
This can change . This can change .
We can get out of poverty .
It &apos;s about having food .
That &apos;s one context .
Getting out of poverty .
The women told us one thing . &quot; Get us technology .
We hate this mortar , to stand hours and hours .
It &apos;s also good with credit .
You can do this .
Africa has not done bad .
Because we don &apos;t consider where they came from .
We have to know a little more about the world .
He knows everything .
But you can do that .
You make a PowerPoint , you know ?
Homage to the Office package , no ?
Everyone wants your pet thing .
We need everything .
Let me first grade what are the most important means .
It was the government that made law function finally .
Education , human resources are important .
Environment is important .
Human rights is also important , but it just gets one cross .
Now what about goals ? Where are we going toward ?
We are not interested in money .
Money is not a goal .
And that &apos;s good , it gets two plusses .
Environment is very , very crucial .
But where are the important goals ?
Of course , it &apos;s human rights .
That &apos;s the value of living .
So the seemingly impossible is possible .
Bring me my sword !
Sword swallowing is from ancient India .
And it &apos;s all solid steel -- you can hear here .
Can I request a moment of absolute silence ?
Patricia Kuhl : The linguistic genius of babies
I want you to take a look at this baby .
And therein lies a critical puzzle .
Well , it &apos;s got to do with your brain .
After puberty , we fall off the map .
What have we learned ?
Two months later something incredible occurs .
So there are two things going on .
And those distributions grow .
English has a lot of Rs and Ls .
The distribution shows .
Six to eight months , they &apos;re totally equivalent .
Two months later , something incredible happens .
Here &apos;s what it looked like in the laboratory .
So a group of babies came in and listened to English .
What did we do to their brains ?
The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics .
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars .
But it &apos;s completely safe , completely non-invasive and silent .
So this is little Emma .
She &apos;s a six-monther .
You can see , she can move around .
It &apos;s a technical tour de force .
What are we seeing ?
We &apos;re seeing the baby brain .
Thank you .
Julian Assange : Why the world needs WikiLeaks
Julian , welcome .
Can that possibly be true ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
How does it work ?
How do people release the documents ?
God damn it .
So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
If we can have this document up ...
J So this is the Kroll Report .
He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
And so it came in from the outside .
J Yep .
You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
Light &apos; em all up .
C &apos;mon , fire !
Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n .
Keep shoot &apos; n .
All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
Roger . I got &apos; em .
Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
So , what was the impact of that ?
J The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
I mean , did he ?
J We have denied receiving those cables .
J We would have released them .
J Yeah .
So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
J Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
So they are well-motivated .
What would you say to that ?
J Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
Light is good .
We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
You know , hero -- people &apos;s hero -- bringing this important light .
Dangerous troublemaker .
Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
What is this ?
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
And we were like , &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
Is it really yours ? &quot;
Yeah .
That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
That &apos;s a problem .
J Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
Can that be right ?
J What , the movie business ?
J Well , I was a journalist .
So you have to be careful with hacker .
So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
J I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
Instead , they publicized your side .
J Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
Iceland went through this financial crisis .
Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
Wow .
Last question , Julian .
J I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
J Thank you , Chris .
Andrew Bird : A one-man orchestra of the imagination
So , I wanted to do something special today .
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms .
They &apos;re feedback loops .
And I &apos;m going to demonstrate for you .
I &apos;m not going to hurt you . Don &apos;t worry .
That &apos;s what it feels like to me .
It &apos;s not pleasant .
So that &apos;s getting a little more closer to a personal experience .
That &apos;s the thing .
All right .
It doesn &apos;t have a name yet .
All right .
Charles Limb : Your brain on improv
And so why don &apos;t we go and click the video .
I think -- how can this possibly be ?
There &apos;s not too many brain-dead people creating art .
Is it truly possible to study creativity scientifically ?
And I think that &apos;s a good question .
And so it gets down to the brain .
Now the way that &apos;s done is by the following .
This is a short video of how we did this project .
CL : Okay , so it works .
We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment .
And the musicians , they were comfortable in the end .
And so we first measured the number of notes .
That was not what was going on .
And then we looked at the brain activity .
I &apos;m going to try to condense this for you .
Really , consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe .
So this is a twelve-bar blues .
Nurse : Nothing &apos;s in your pockets , right Mike ?
MP : Nope . Nothing &apos;s in my pockets . Nurse : Okay .
CL : You have to have the right attitude to agree to it .
It &apos;s kind of fun actually .
And so now we &apos;re playing back and forth .
And then I &apos;m in the control room here , playing back and forth .
And it &apos;s good that it &apos;s not too quick .
That was challenging .
CL : At this point , I &apos;ll take a few moments .
This is one subject &apos;s data .
This is , in fact , Mike Pope &apos;s data .
So what am I showing you here ?
Rap , of course , rap -- free-style .
And so I &apos;ve always been fascinated by free-style .
And let &apos;s go ahead and play this video here .
So how do you study rap scientifically ?
And then I thought -- But here &apos;s the thing .
Go ahead and hit that right sound icon .
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s coming .
It &apos;s doing something that , neurologically , is remarkable .
Creatively speaking , it &apos;s just a phenomenal thing .
CL : We &apos;re here with Emmanuel .
CL : That &apos;s Emmanuel in the scanner .
He &apos;s just memorized a rhyme for us .
Well , this is actually four rappers &apos; brains .
It &apos;s very preliminary , but I think it &apos;s kind of cool .
Dean Ornish : The killer American diet that &apos;s sweeping the planet
Afra Raymond : Three myths about corruption
Okay , this morning I &apos;m speaking on the question of corruption .
Okay ? Friends , family and financiers .
That &apos;s the honest truth .
Public and private corruption is a reality .
It &apos;s a piece of public mischief .
It went right into my heart .
So the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief .
Okay ? This is the size of the problem .
That was 30 years ago . 1982 was Ballah .
So what has changed ?
the Piarco Airport accused .
They are the Piarco Airport accused .
Our highest institution in our country was perverted .
Do you get how serious this problem is ?
So that is the kind of outrage of the thing .
But what were they accused of ?
What was it that they were accused of ?
It was autumn . It was cool . It was damp . It was getting dark .
My brain started thinking .
Let &apos;s understand , because we lack context .
It &apos;s not just like anywhere .
I &apos;m serious now .
They &apos;ve had bailouts in London .
Let &apos;s look at it . Let &apos;s look into it .
It &apos;s a not-for-profit blog that I run .
Okay ? We want to try to recalculate .
The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over .
This is the other context .
That is the law since 1999 .
Here is not like anywhere else .
What are the figures he &apos;s relying on ?
So they hit my question with a question .
There &apos;s a particular individual who is in the government now .
The name of the person doesn &apos;t matter .
Okay ? His name isn &apos;t important .
Fantastic .
It &apos;s been ignored .
And this is my reality check .
If it is I have to go to court personally , I will do that .
We will continue to press on .
We will continue to work within JCC .
I could see what you &apos;re applying for .
We need to increase the consciousness .
Discard the first myth ; it is a crime .
Discard the second myth ; it is a big thing .
Jill Sobule : Global warming &apos;s theme song , &quot; Manhattan in January &quot;
Okay .
Rating agencies are rating companies .
They are rating banks .
Be honest .
Well , ratings affect you .
They affect all of us .
There is no incentive to improve the quality of your product .
I think it &apos;s time for a bold move .
I think it &apos;s time to upgrade the system .
Think about it that way .
How is it managed ?
So in contrast to the current system , INCRA would be fully transparent .
It &apos;s time to give them some company .
Thank you .
Evan Grant : Making sound visible through cymatics
He actually coined the term cymatics .
As you can see with your own eyes .
So , what excites me about cymatics ?
Well , for me cymatics is an almost magical tool .
It &apos;s like a looking glass into a hidden world .
So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit .
And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature .
And there is thousands of these .
So what does this all mean ?
But consider for a moment that sound does have form .
And think about the immense sound of the universe forming .
Cymatics is accessible to everybody .
I think collectively we can build a global community .
We can inspire each other .
Did I mention they &apos;re gorgeous ?
And they &apos;re scientific models ?
Well , let &apos;s think about the drug screening process for a moment .
And the later it fails , the worse the consequences .
They were developed in Japan pretty recently .
Okay , induced pluripotent stem cells .
This is a degeneration of the retina .
Well , this is another trend in the field .
Thank you .
Anybody ? Anybody ? Yeah !
They could fly in the air . They could bend their elbow all the way back .
They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row .
I &apos;d never seen anything like that .
I grew up in a musical family .
And those guys , those were like , ultimate heroes .
They &apos;re here , getting better and better every day .
And dance has progressed .
It is insane what dance is right now .
Dance has never had a better friend than technology .
Online videos and social networking ...
And this is happening every day .
We got Madd Chadd , Lil &apos; C , Kid David and J Smooth .
Please be excited , have fun , yell , scream .
Ladies and gentlemen : The LXD .
You know , you create power , then you tame it .
In this case , it &apos;s very simple .
And they are around three billion such letters long .
Well we can begin to ask those questions also .
This may be surprising .
Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so .
So this is very surprising .
What happened to the Neanderthals ?
Did we mix or not ?
And that &apos;s indeed the case .
Well I don &apos;t think that is the case .
Thank you for your attention .
Shlomo Benartzi : Saving for tomorrow , tomorrow
I &apos;m going to talk about Save More Tomorrow .
So let &apos;s think about how we manage our money .
Let &apos;s start with mortgages .
And then they foreclose .
We were risk takers , of course .
So we &apos;re probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking .
How many of you have iPhones ?
Anyone ? Wonderful .
What if you lose your iPhone ?
What if you do this ?
How many of you have kids ?
Anyone ?
I see a lot of hands coming down .
We &apos;re not doing that well when it comes to insurance .
And I know it sounds crazy .
No one .
So where does it take us ?
We &apos;re not doing a great job managing money .
I want to address the issue of savings .
And we &apos;re going to look at their saving behavior .
They cannot make savings easy .
What about the remaining half of the people ?
Some of them elect not to save .
They &apos;re just too lazy .
How many people end up saving to a 401 plan ?
One third of Americans .
Two thirds are not saving now .
Are they saving enough ?
One out of 10 are saving enough .
Let &apos;s look at that .
Roughly half a percent of Americans feel that they save too much .
What are we going to do about it ?
That &apos;s what I really want to focus on .
Who would go for bananas ?
Wonderful .
I predict scientifically 74 percent of you will go for bananas .
Wonderful study comparing different countries .
Not many people like checking boxes .
It takes effort . You need to think .
Twelve percent do .
What &apos;s the difference ?
Well , you still have choice .
You will decide whether you want to donate your organs or not .
Nobody checks boxes .
That &apos;s kind of too much effort .
One percent check the box . The rest do nothing .
Doing nothing is very common .
Not many people check boxes .
In Germany , 12 percent check the box .
Twelve percent are organ donors .
In Austria , again , nobody checks the box .
Therefore , 99 percent of people are organ donors .
Inertia , lack of action .
Very powerful .
And checking the box takes effort .
So we &apos;ve chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges .
They still have an apple left .
They &apos;re really mad .
Why have you taken our apple ?
This is the notion of loss aversion .
It &apos;s very painful , even though it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
It &apos;s a lot more fun to spend now .
It &apos;s an autopilot .
Well , maybe it shouldn &apos;t be just January .
Saving more today is not an option .
And here are the results .
It &apos;s real .
This is a real difference .
It &apos;s been part of the Pension Protection Act .
Let me wrap with two key messages .
One is behavioral finance is extremely powerful .
This is just one example .
This is really the tip of the iceberg .
The average actually , the record is in Singapore .
One , two , three , four .
Less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience .
Behavioral finance has a long way .
Thank you .
I &apos;m almost like a crazy evangelical .
I love them . So we are in the right quadrant .
But here comes the art critic . Oh , that was fantastic .
So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian .
&quot; Sorry , MoMA , video games are not art . &quot;
And Jonathan Jones is making it happen .
And does it matter ? &quot; Thank you . Does it matter ?
Thank you very much . And that &apos;s more than enough .
&quot; That misses the point . &quot;
Excuse me . You &apos;re missing the point .
And you know what ?
I think this was truly fantastic .
And the same with , for instance , Tetris , original version , the Soviet one .
And it &apos;s fantastic .
We worked on it for a year and a half .
They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation .
I mean , that interface is beautiful .
Not to mention Eve Online .
It was amazing to see . And it &apos;s a beautiful game .
Right ? We had to make decisions .
And I was like , &quot; Why ? &quot;
So it &apos;s very interesting .
We have Street Fighter II , because martial arts are good .
So it was not very constructive .
It &apos;s like , it &apos;s about serenity and it &apos;s about sublime .
So it &apos;s quite a hefty collection .
What we want , what we aspire to , is the code .
It &apos;s very hard to get , of course .
They also preserve artifacts for posterity .
We &apos;re going to stay with them forever .
They &apos;re not going to get rid of us .
And so is space , the spatial aspect of games .
The real core issue of interaction design is behavior .
I would like to do the same with video games .
I want it to keep flying .
I &apos;ve had to do away with a few concepts of design past .
Thank you very much .
Peter Saul : Let &apos;s talk about dying
There will be no exceptions to that .
So there you go . That &apos;s the truth .
This has been fantastic .
We have machines that go ping .
There &apos;s many of them up there .
His is the little hand .
He said , &quot; Look , there &apos;s a guy down here .
Which is a familiar phrase to us .
You can see his bones through the skin .
I thought , &quot; Okay . Take this steady . &quot;
Jim was 94 .
One in a hundred .
Now , I work in acute care .
This is John Hunter Hospital .
In the U.S. , it &apos;s one in five .
These are the four ways to go .
Sudden death has become very rare .
The big growth industry are these .
Enjoying it so far ?
We are all , most of us , living to reach this point .
You know , historically , we didn &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m sorry to say that .
She looks terrified .
It &apos;s an amazing picture .
We were able to make that happen for them .
The cultural issue had reasserted itself .
And this is the small idea .
There are a couple of things you can do .
So that &apos;s the little idea .
I think we have to get onto this .
I suggested we should have Occupy Death .
Yeah , yeah . Sure . &quot;
Now , I &apos;m an aging hippie .
She founded the hospice movement .
Thank you .
But I was intrigued .
I mean , satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff .
How much oil is stored in all of China ?
How much corn is being produced ?
How many ships are in all of our world &apos;s ports ?
Because they are so expensive , there aren &apos;t very many of them .
Why do these things have to be so expensive ?
We had found our compromise .
So now we had our constraint .
Thank you .
Stewart Brand + Mark Z. Jacobson : Debate : Does the world need nuclear energy ?
We &apos;re having a debate .
So those who are &quot; yes , &quot; raise your hand . &quot; For . &quot;
Okay , hands down .
Those who are against , raise your hands .
Okay , I &apos;m reading that at about 75 to 25 in favor at the start .
Stewart Brand : Whoa .
live in the developing world .
We are moving to cities . We are moving up in the world .
And if it isn &apos;t easily gotten , we &apos;ll go ahead and steal it .
Electricity for cities , at its best , is what &apos;s called baseload electricity .
That &apos;s where it is on all the time .
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years .
Then what happens to the waste ?
Wind is wonderful ; I love wind .
I love being around these big wind generators .
They &apos;ve run out of good sites .
The power lines are getting overloaded .
And you peak out .
Well , as an environmentalist , we would rather that didn &apos;t happen .
It &apos;s okay on frapped-out agricultural land .
Solar &apos;s wonderful on rooftops .
We haven &apos;t even started the American stockpile .
This is one from Toshiba .
Typically , these things are put in the ground .
They &apos;re referred to as nuclear batteries .
They &apos;re incredibly safe , weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it .
Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold &apos;s involved in .
And here &apos;s the future .
Okay . Okay .
Mark Jacobson : Thank you .
And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation .
Nuclear -- there are two bars here .
And this is just the CO2 from the life cycle .
Iran is doing that right now .
would be this .
So , do we need this ?
The spacing is something else .
That &apos;s the footprint that is always being confused .
People confuse footprint with spacing .
Over the ocean , it &apos;s not even land .
And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with .
Here &apos;s corn ethanol . It &apos;s smaller .
We want to match the hour-by-hour power supply .
You can do that by combining renewables .
Here are the world wind resources .
So then here &apos;s the final ranking .
If you use wind , you guarantee ice will last .
All right .
If you &apos;re against , put up one .
And I want two of each for the mics .
The reality is that there &apos;s , what , 21 nations that have nuclear power ?
Of those , seven have nuclear weapons .
In every case , they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power .
So the other thing is , we don &apos;t need nuclear energy .
There &apos;s plenty of solar and wind .
That &apos;s from real data .
There &apos;s absolutely no need for nuclear power .
We need someone for .
And I want to support Stewart Brand &apos;s position .
I &apos;ve come around in the last 10 years .
I used to be against nuclear power .
Thank you Rod Beckstrom . Against .
The first is : be aware of the propaganda .
The propaganda from the industry has been very , very strong .
Be very aware of the propaganda .
Secondly , think about this .
Tell me they &apos;re not going to have accidents .
Thank you .
For .
Anyone else for ? Go .
I &apos;ve got solar PV on my roof .
I &apos;ve got a hydro conversion at a watermill that I own .
And I &apos;m , you know , very much &quot; pro &quot; that kind of stuff .
However , there &apos;s a basic arithmetic problem here .
And , ultimately , the arithmetic problem isn &apos;t going to go away .
We need a solution that generates all of the time .
If we &apos;re going to keep the lights on , nuclear is that solution .
Thank you .
Anyone else against ?
I will also add one other thing .
Point well made . Thank you .
Your final pitch , Stewart .
It was a sunny day and a windy night .
All of the wind in the entire country shut down for a week .
None of those things were stirring .
And as usual , they had to buy nuclear power from France .
Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel .
This keeps happening .
I used to worry about the 10,000 year factor .
And especially the small reactors need to go forward .
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.
has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive .
And there &apos;s much more solar than there is wind .
There &apos;s plenty of resource . You can make it reliable .
Okay . So , thank you , Mark .
So if you were in Palm Springs ...
Shameless . Shameless . Shameless .
All those in favor , raise your hands .
And all those against .
Ooooh .
Those of you who changed your mind in favor of &quot; for &quot; put your hands up .
Okay . So here &apos;s the read on it .
You both won . I congratulate both of you .
Thank you for that .
Clay Shirky : How social media can make history
You probably read something about it in the papers .
And so a plan came up to video the vote .
It &apos;s when everybody is able to take them for granted .
That is a huge transformation .
But there is a curious asymmetry here .
And this is what changed .
That &apos;s one of the big changes .
That is a huge change in the media landscape we &apos;re used to .
And it &apos;s not just Internet or no Internet .
Second story .
People were texting from their phones . They were taking photos of buildings .
They were taking videos of buildings shaking .
They were Twittering it .
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter .
And this stuff rippled like wildfire .
But nine of the 10 in those first hours .
This was an incredible , coordinated global response .
And then this happened .
And so the protest kept going .
And finally the Chinese cracked down .
That was enough of citizen media .
And so they began to arrest the protesters .
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on .
The media was produced locally . It was produced by amateurs .
And in fact that is happening this week .
They had to turn the spigot entirely off .
And here is the twentieth century answer .
National message . Targeted individuals .
Relatively sparse number of producers .
Very expensive to do , so there is not a lot of competition .
This is how you reach people .
All of that is over .
The audience can talk back .
Those days are over , never to return .
An incredible conversation sprung up there .
I &apos;m going to vote for this bill . &quot;
&quot; Please get FISA right . &quot;
Obama had to issue a press release .
He had to issue a reply .
I understand where you are coming from .
That &apos;s the media environment we &apos;ve got .
Thank you very much .
Let me connect the dots .
It &apos;s old-school demographics .
They can make some educated guesses .
It had been presumed before .
It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution .
This is far too simplistic .
Why should I know this ?
Can you even imagine what that looks like ?
I can &apos;t wait to find out what it looks like .
Thank you so much .
Lauren Hodge , Shree Bose + Naomi Shah : Award-winning teenage science in action
However , grilled chicken poses a hidden danger .
These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens .
So I was very surprised about this .
Is it worth it to you ?
How will you cook your chicken now ?
Shree Bose : Hi everyone . I &apos;m Shree Bose .
Sounds ridiculous , right .
But that was me years ago .
And that was my first science fair project .
It got a bit more complicated from there .
Good plan .
Got rejected by all except one .
And that is where the research began .
One in 100 will die from it .
Sounds great , right ?
It &apos;s a huge problem .
So that &apos;s what we set out to do .
And that &apos;s huge .
But my work wasn &apos;t just about the research .
It was about finding my passion .
Thank you .
1.6 million deaths worldwide .
One death every 20 seconds .
People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors .
They &apos;re everywhere .
And this can be used by anyone .
Stop the use of incense and candles .
Thank you .
Lisa Ling : Right .
Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly ?
Your winners .
Yang Lan : The generation that &apos;s remaking China
Guess who was the performing guest ?
Susan Boyle .
It means &quot; green onion for free . &quot;
Why did she say that ?
That was hilarious .
Well , being different is not that difficult .
We are all different from different perspectives .
You may have the chance to make a difference .
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot;
I thought I kind of offended them .
But actually , they were impressed by my words .
After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
It is still boiling .
On Tencent , 200 million .
So how are they different ?
Most of them have fairly good education .
In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
College graduates are not in short supply .
Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
They &apos;re not rich at all .
And also , people are doing good through social media .
Thank you very much .
Bruno Maisonnier : Dance , tiny robots !
Stefan Sagmeister : The power of time off
I run a design studio in New York .
We are totally closed .
And I get , over time , bored by them .
So I decided to close it down for one year .
That &apos;s clearly enjoyable for myself .
And they rang very true for me .
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays .
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism .
In a career I &apos;m definitely more engaged .
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City .
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself .
Every single dog on one tee shirt .
And then just leave it all to them .
And I don &apos;t have to do anything .
So I looked for furniture .
It &apos;s not quite finished yet .
It &apos;s called Be Here Now .
It includes 330 compasses .
So I will not really go too far into it .
His restaurant is open seven months every year .
His latest numbers are fairly impressive .
There is some good successes .
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical ?
That &apos;s about five percent of everybody .
So I became my own intern .
Was not very successful . And so on and so forth .
What came out of it ?
I really got close to design again .
I had fun .
Because of the improved quality , we could ask for higher prices .
So then it became quite easy .
That &apos;s connected to a scanner .
You put any image in there , like that Beethoven image .
So it will always fit together , conceptually , of course .
There is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building .
It has a more transparent identity .
The truck they go on tour with .
You can grow it underneath the skin .
On one hand I have nothing against selling .
My parents are both salespeople .
There must be something else .
And the whole series of work came out of it .
Some of you might have seen it .
I &apos;ll just show two now .
It says , &quot; Self-confidence produces fine results . &quot;
This is after a week .
After two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now ? &quot;
I think you see , you see them sweeping . You see them sweeping right here .
That &apos;s the police , getting rid of it all .
We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali .
It &apos;s a movie about happiness .
They weren &apos;t quite slick enough .
And I think she overdid it .
Just a bit too ornamental .
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest .
So we asked those guys to do it again .
So it &apos;s going to be a while .
And I &apos;m happy I &apos;m alive .
Stefan Sagmeister : Thank you .
Kakenya Ntaiya : A girl who demanded school
There &apos;s a group of people in Kenya .
These people are tall .
They jump high . They wear red .
And they kill lions .
These are the Maasais .
The Maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors .
The girls are brought up to be mothers .
Cool , yeah ?
Why did she say that ?
My father worked as a policeman in the city .
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for sometimes even two years .
She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us .
When I went to school , I had a dream .
I wanted to become a teacher .
Teachers looked nice .
So I wanted to become a teacher .
This was the crossroad .
I did . The ceremony happened .
It &apos;s a whole week long of excitement .
It &apos;s a ceremony . People are enjoying it .
They were all in a circle .
And I sat down , and I opened my legs .
We were taken care of .
Well , while I was in high school , something happened .
And I told him , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that part .
Just tell me how to get there . &quot;
This gentleman , he helped me .
While I was in high school also , my dad was sick .
The first thing he sees when he opens his door is , it &apos;s me .
&quot; My child , what are you doing here ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , but I can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
They all came together .
I found snow !
I was in a land of plenty .
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya .
I learned that my mom had a right to own property .
Those things made me angry .
I wanted to do something .
I had to do something .
Because there had not been any school for girls .
She &apos;s beaten .
That made sense . And they agreed .
We have .
And yes , she was older to be in fourth grade .
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class .
Five months later , that is Angeline .
A transformation had begun in her life .
That &apos;s Sharon . That &apos;s five years later .
I want to challenge you today .
You are somebody who is so passionate .
You are somebody who wants to make a difference .
Be the first . People will follow you .
Be bold . Stand up . Be fearless . Be confident .
Ravin Agrawal : 10 young Indian artists to watch
The first is Bharti Kher .
I , for one , was steeped in these .
He too is reinventing the miniature tradition .
Thank you very much for looking and listening .
Dyan deNapoli : The great penguin rescue
And I could not disagree more .
Now at the time , I was working down the street .
And this is what happened .
The other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers .
We just did not know .
And there really were no good solutions .
So penguins learn from previous experience , too .
And was Silvia Gaus right ?
Well she could not be more wrong .
Just look at that 17 year-old .
Thank you .
Paul Zak : Trust , morality -- and oxytocin ?
Is there anything unique about human beings ?
There is .
We &apos;re obsessed with morality as social creatures .
And I personally am obsessed with morality .
I want to know if there was a moral molecule .
After 10 years of experiments , I found it .
This little syringe contains the moral molecule .
It &apos;s called oxytocin .
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule .
It can &apos;t be that important . &quot;
There must be a reason why . &quot;
But it was testably stupid .
Turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
First of all , oxytocin is a shy molecule .
I think I can do that .
Then I had to measure morality .
So I started smaller .
I studied one single virtue : trustworthiness .
But I &apos;m also a skeptic .
So we recruit some people for an experiment .
Then we match them in pairs by computer .
You only do it one time .
You &apos;re going to make them a lot wealthier .
So think about this experiment for minute .
So this was the birth of vampire economics .
Make a decision and give me some blood .
They assumed money is good , why not keep it all ?
But why ?
But wait . What &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
Two things .
These include massage , dancing and praying .
Yes , my mom was happy about that last one .
But why do they do this ?
It &apos;s empathy that makes us moral .
Now this idea is not new .
So I tend to avoid that .
So I tend to do those things .
I just found the molecule behind it .
Opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
&quot; Well this is very valuable .
I said , &quot; Pearl necklace ? &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot;
&quot; Hey , a guy just found it . &quot;
Tell that guy to wait half an hour .
Get yourself a fat reward . Life &apos;s good . &quot;
Now we know what happens .
So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?
We call them bastards .
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths .
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited .
Also , high stress inhibits oxytocin .
And we have testosterone .
It &apos;s all inside of us .
Yeah , I &apos;ve been worrying about that too .
200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And guess what ?
Who is the center of the wedding solar system ?
The bride .
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
Her mother , that &apos;s right .
Her mother was number two .
For example , through social media .
Many people are Tweeting right now .
And they had the reporters and their producers participate .
So he was using social media in private .
They checked .
He was interacting on his girlfriend &apos;s Facebook page .
There you go . That &apos;s connection .
And they indeed also release oxytocin .
So oxytocin connects us to other people .
Let me show it to you .
Come here . Give me a hug .
There you go .
Thank you .
Rebecca Saxe : How we read each other &apos;s minds
Today I &apos;m going to talk to you about the problem of other minds .
Obviously the whole project here is huge .
This is a picture of it .
It &apos;s called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction .
So this brain region is called the Right TPJ .
They &apos;re MIT undergraduates .
And you know what pirates really like ?
What ? RS : Pirates really like cheese sandwiches .
Cheese ? I love cheese !
I really love cheese sandwiches . &quot;
And so Ivan goes to get a drink .
And now , here comes the other pirate .
This pirate is called Joshua .
And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches .
So , that one is his .
RS : That &apos;s exactly right .
RS : Oh . So now Joshua goes off to get a drink .
So which one do you think Ivan is going to take ?
I think he is going to take that one .
Oh yeah , you were right . He took that one .
Which sandwich is he going to take ?
Let &apos;s see what he does . Here comes Ivan .
And he takes this one .
Uh-oh . Why did he take that one ?
His was on the grass .
So that &apos;s why he &apos;s taking the other sandwich .
Now of course , development doesn &apos;t end at five .
Yeah .
Yeah .
But now I &apos;m going to show you the five-year-old .
Um , yeah .
No , because the wind should get in trouble .
But it &apos;s not quite like the adult brain .
And I &apos;m going to give that to you now .
And Grace &apos;s friend asks for some sugar in her coffee .
And her friend drinks the coffee , and is fine .
Okay . Good .
Now she thinks the powder is sugar .
And we do have such a tool .
It &apos;s called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation , or TMS .
Woman : Ready , Rebecca ? RS : Yes .
It &apos;s getting them wrong that is living .
Thank you .
RS : I &apos;m not .
They really are calling ?
RS : Yeah , we worry about this .
So , there &apos;s a couple of things to say about TMS .
One is that you can &apos;t be TMSed without knowing it .
So it &apos;s not a surreptitious technology .
We changed their ability to judge other people &apos;s actions .
But why does anyone have to feel anything ?
You &apos;re a brilliant young neuroscientist .
Why ?
Scott Fraser : Why eyewitnesses get it wrong
And the car sped off .
The police , investigating officers , were amazingly efficient .
So what &apos;s wrong ?
Straightforward , fair trial , full investigation .
And Mr. Carrillo &apos;s alibi ?
So what &apos;s the problem ?
It &apos;s called reconstructed memories .
Well , what &apos;s that got to do with this ?
As you can see , it is at best poor .
Their eyes just glaze over , all right ?
A shocker in American jurisprudence .
That &apos;s 30 feet away .
Okay . There &apos;s 15 feet .
At this point , I became a little concerned .
And this is three to four feet away .
Why did I take the risk ?
This is what he saw .
Which they decided not to .
The opposing council always fight it and oppose it .
We all have to be very careful .
They &apos;re dynamic .
Thank you .
Doris Kim Sung : Metal that breathes
So there &apos;s no more signal for us to tell us to stop .
That &apos;s the first line of defense for the body .
And this gets me back to my research .
This last project is also of components .
Sheila Nirenberg : A prosthetic eye to treat blindness
So let me start in on that problem .
There are 10 million people in the U.S.
Here you have a retina .
So you have an image , a retina , and a brain .
Anyway , you get the idea .
How important is this ?
What &apos;s the potential impact on a patient &apos;s ability to see ?
Jonathan Harris : The web as art
So I &apos;ll be talking about each of those today .
Have fun in whatever you do . &quot;
It &apos;s called &quot; We Feel Fine . &quot;
This is , then , how they &apos;re presented .
And the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside .
Also , some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts .
&quot; I feel good . &quot;
So the next movement is called mobs .
This provides a slightly more statistical look at things .
These are the images that are automatically constructed .
&quot; I can feel my cancer grow . &quot;
&quot; I feel pretty . &quot;
&quot; I feel skinny , but I &apos;m not . &quot;
&quot; I feel sassy . &quot;
&quot; I feel so sexy in this new wig . &quot;
Sometimes , stories as short as two or three words .
And recently , I &apos;ve become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story .
The first such one is called &quot; The Whale Hunt . &quot;
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals .
So every five minutes , I took a photograph .
When I was awake , with the camera around my neck .
When I was sleeping , with a tripod and a timer .
That was the first concept here .
What are the things that make up a story ?
So , stories have characters . Stories have concepts .
Stories take place in a certain area . They have contexts .
They have colors . What do they look like ?
We &apos;re very used to this .
But if you think about real life , it &apos;s not like that at all .
So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there .
And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean .
These are organized chronologically .
That &apos;s &quot; Moby Dick . &quot;
This is the food we ate .
Cigarette break outside -- I don &apos;t smoke .
This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping .
This is out at whale camp , on the Arctic Ocean .
It &apos;s baleen . Moving on .
And it leads to just a completely different value system .
And then finally , I would ask them to make a wish .
This is an 11-year-old student .
His wish was to become a police officer .
A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner .
He wanted to help poor people .
She wanted to keep farming until she dies .
You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here .
A 16-year-old quarry worker .
A 21-year-old monk . He was very happy .
He wanted to live a long life at the monastery .
He was kind of too shy to make a funny face .
A 16-year-old student .
She wanted to become an independent woman .
A 24-year-old truck driver .
She wanted a change in her life .
An 81-year-old itinerant farmer .
It was all good-natured .
A 10-year-old .
A 37-year-old road worker .
Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet .
And I said , &quot; Wow , and how long will you live in the cave ? &quot;
And this is what she said .
Jonathan Harris : Maybe you &apos;ll die ? Yes .
JH : Are you hoping to ?
JH : 40 to 50 ? Yeah .
Yes . From then , I &apos;m going to the heaven .
JH : Well , I wish you the best of luck with it .
Thank you .
JH : I hope it &apos;s everything that you hope it will be .
So thank you again , so much .
You &apos;re most welcome .
And they &apos;re actually still flying up there today .
You can start to see some familiar balloons here .
Thanks very much .
Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
All right . One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful .
Ow ! Ow !
They begin with a question .
Okay ?
It &apos;s play .
The first step was to ask a question .
Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
So Amy , would you please come up ?
Student : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ?
They say no .
What was the feedback like ?
And I &apos;ll just read one .
Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
Can I do it on you ?
Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
And you like technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
Now ...
Okay .
Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
Everyone over there shout .
Where &apos;s the sound coming from ?
Thank you very much .
So , Amy ?
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Catarina Mota : Play with smart materials
Let me show you some examples .
Well first of all , because I am a maker .
But that &apos;s not always the case .
Thank you .
Wadah Khanfar : A historic moment in the Arab world
Ten years ago exactly , I was in Afghanistan .
I &apos;m 43 years old right now .
And this is why they revolted .
This is why they did not accept .
Would you like to see destruction ?
This is what happened in Tunisia .
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people .
They found something called Facebook .
They found something called Twitter .
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues .
And they said , &quot; These kids are misled . &quot;
We are going to spread the message .
And now Libya as you see it .
And then you have Yemen .
And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world .
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories .
Fortunately , people right now cannot be deceived .
They have lost .
Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution .
We do not create revolutions .
Let us accept the choice of the people .
Let us support these people .
Let us stand for them .
I thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
I just have a couple of questions for you .
Thank you for coming here .
We have covered many wars .
You are witnessing change in history .
You are witnessing the birth of a new era .
And this is what the story &apos;s all about .
Fifty percent of it is coming from America .
They &apos;ve had some speakers there .
Thank you so much .
Sebastião Salgado : The silent drama of photography
A marvelous place .
Very few things went to the market .
There I learned different things .
I &#91; went to &#93; university to become an economist .
I &#91; did &#93; a master &apos;s degree in economics .
Brazil radicalized very strongly .
I worked after for an investment bank .
But I did much more than that .
I put photography as my life .
I saw in Rwanda total brutality .
I lost my faith in our species .
I started to have infection everywhere .
You must stop . Stop .
And I made the decision to stop .
It was a big coincidence .
And Léila came up with an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
Let &apos;s build the paradise again .
We transformed . We gave this land back to nature .
It became a national park .
We must protect the forest in this sense .
Well , this — — Thank you . Thank you very much .
But we create an incredible contradiction .
Gone very fast , disappeared .
That is the essence of our life , these forests .
A lack of oxygen in the water .
For the water system , the trees are essential .
The trees are the hair of our planet .
There are thousands of trees .
And I &apos;ll show you the last picture .
We are with two million trees in the ground now .
Thank you very much .
Catherine Mohr : The tradeoffs of building green
First of all , I &apos;m a geek .
And so I have to figure this out for myself .
For example : Is this evil ?
But can I use a paper towel ?
Wipe it up , throw it away .
This is now operating energy .
Well , now a paper towel looks better .
And now all bets are off .
We wanted to know how much better we could do .
So first , we demolish it .
We then put in framing .
We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising .
And yet , all the press is focused on that .
Except for flooring .
So what does this mean ?
But my elephant in the living room flies .
Clearly , I need to walk home from TED .
Thank you .
How many of you love rhythm ?
Oh yeah , oh yeah . Oh yeah .
I mean , I love all kinds of rhythm .
Clayton Cameron : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : Yeah .
What ?
Yeah . Three is a magic number .
Three is a groovin &apos; number .
Three is a hip-hop kind of number .
But what does subdividing by three mean ?
And counting off by four ?
Well , look , think of it this way .
A measure of music as a dollar .
And so does a 4 / 4 measure of music .
It has four quarter notes .
Now , how do you subdivide ?
Now let &apos;s envision this : three dollars &apos; worth of quarters .
And listen to this .
CC : There you go .
All right , second line .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three . Yeah .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
One , two , one , two , a-one-two-three-four .
Yeah . Mm .
Aha .
A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
CC : Yeah . Hip-hop .
Triplet-triplet . Say it with me .
All : Triplet-triplet .
CC : Triplet-triplet . Triplet-triplet .
A-rhythm-etic .
I &apos;m a neuroscientist .
Think about it .
So I am a movement chauvinist .
Think about the game of chess .
That problem is solved .
There &apos;s no competition at all .
So it &apos;s a very simple algorithm .
And she &apos;s pretty happy .
And it sounds like an easy problem .
You have a huge spread due to movement variability .
The teapot could be full , it could be empty .
It changes over time .
So let &apos;s think about the inference .
You want to generate beliefs about the world .
So what are beliefs ?
But we &apos;re going to represent beliefs with probabilities .
You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories .
And I &apos;ve put the formula up there .
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power .
So let me give you an intuitive example .
There are two sources of information Bayes &apos; rule tells you .
Now both these sources of information carry important information .
So that really means I have to make predictions of the future .
But you can imagine looking inside the brain .
And here &apos;s inside the brain .
Well why would I bother doing that ?
Well there &apos;s good reasons .
So I get two sources .
Everything left over is external to me .
What evidence is there for this ?
The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle .
It quickly escalates .
And the game is very simple .
Use your other hand to apply the force back down .
But we &apos;ve got a problem .
And there &apos;s a big gap between the task and the movement system .
Now it turns out , we are extremely stereotypical .
We all move the same way pretty much .
Now this is a bunch of dots moving .
Well let &apos;s think about what really happens .
Maybe we don &apos;t all quite move the same way .
Maybe there &apos;s variation in the population .
Here are two possible paths to that ball .
But there &apos;s noise added to this .
There are many diseases which effect movement .
Thank you very much .
Quick question for you , Dan .
So you &apos;re a movement -- -- chauvinist .
John La Grou : A plug for smart power outlets
This is a world-changing invention .
But smoke alarms don &apos;t prevent fires .
Well , a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this .
So how does electricity ignite residential fires ?
Our invention had to address all of these issues .
So what about circuit breakers ?
Well , Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879 .
Hmmm ...
The appliance &apos;s safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug .
There are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone .
The potential energy savings is very , very significant .
So far we &apos;ve applied for 414 patent claims .
Thank you .
Erica Frenkel : The universal anesthesia machine
It &apos;s a pretty expensive machine .
Those machines go the proverbial junkyard .
It &apos;s not just inappropriate , it becomes really unsafe .
And everything began pretty auspiciously .
The nurse was there .
Because her machine doesn &apos;t work when there &apos;s no power .
There has to be something better . &quot;
Voila !
Here she is .
Everything else is the same .
This is the only part that &apos;s battery backed up .
So it &apos;s a straightforward machine .
I shudder to say simple ; it &apos;s straightforward .
And it &apos;s by design .
This is an incredibly rugged machine .
And finally , it &apos;s affordable .
But we &apos;re not content to stop there .
Is it working ?
Well we &apos;ve seen good results so far .
So we &apos;re thrilled .
They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore .
Who gets surgery and who doesn &apos;t ?
Who gets safe surgery and who doesn &apos;t ?
Thank you very much .
Eric Berlow : Simplifying complexity
All the grayed-out species disappear .
I can sink my teeth into this . &quot;
I want you to be excited . I want you to be relieved .
Because simple answers may emerge .
Thank you .
Nick Veasey : Exposing the invisible
That image was the start of the X-ray technology .
And the bus is full of people .
It &apos;s actually the same person . It &apos;s just one skeleton .
But everyone on that bus is Frieda .
Again though , to make it come alive you need , somehow , to add the human element .
Quite a difficult brief , make a pair of men &apos;s pants look beautiful .
The creases in the material and the sort of nuances .
The design comes from within .
So , that &apos;s an empty parka jacket .
But I quite love the way it &apos;s posed .
Nature is my greatest inspiration .
An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional .
Seaweed , ebbing in the tide .
is made of lead and steel .
The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete .
So , I &apos;m using quite a lot of radiation .
A lot more than you &apos;d get in a hospital or a vet &apos;s .
So , still working with film , I &apos;m afraid .
They scan each individual X-ray .
So , this is , again , my daughter &apos;s dress .
But there are four X-ray plates .
You can see them overlapping .
In fact , that is three months solid X-raying .
There is over 500 separate components .
I kid you not .
Okay , so Frieda is my dead skeleton .
This , unfortunately , is basically two pictures .
One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer .
The one on the left is an x-ray .
But this time I had to use a real body .
So , here I had to use a recently deceased body .
And when they do , I &apos;m in the queue .
So , I like to use them .
The coloring , so coloring adds another level to the X-rays .
It makes it more organic , more natural .
It &apos;s whatever takes my fancy , really .
It &apos;s not accurately colored to how it is in real life .
That flower doesn &apos;t come in bright orange , I don &apos;t think .
But I just like it in bright orange .
It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional .
The thing in there is very dangerous .
If you touch that , you could possibly die through radiation poisoning .
It &apos;s cumulative .
It has human connotations .
And it &apos;s just a bit spooky .
And that &apos;s how this was done . It &apos;s actually slice , slice .
It &apos;s a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital . Slices .
I have very high-tech equipment of gloves , scissors and a bucket .
Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves .
Look at this monster .
It &apos;s so basic . It just grows wild .
It &apos;s just happening .
And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be .
The lighter the object , the less radiation .
So , these leaves at the edge would start to disappear .
What I like is how hard the edges are , how sharp .
Yeah , I &apos;m quite pleased with it .
And that &apos;s the sort of thing I &apos;ve been doing .
Unfortunately I haven &apos;t got X-ray vision .
So , what am I doing in the future ?
And this is quite a good way of doing it .
I &apos;m also working now with X-ray video .
Ursus Wehrli : Tidying up art
So the reading would be over very quickly .
You won &apos;t be familiar with it .
Yeah , I kind of felt sorry for him .
It &apos;s a picture by Paul Klee .
Yeah , that &apos;s great .
And that &apos;s really advanced tidying up .
We are only happy when things are in order .
This is a picture by Joan Miro .
It &apos;s more economical and also more efficient .
I &apos;ll just quote from the specification .
One , two , three .
That &apos;s a picture by Keith Haring .
I think it doesn &apos;t matter .
This is Keith Haring looked at statistically .
One can obviously also make combinations .
In the end , one has a list with which one then can arrange .
And here , that &apos;s one of my favorites .
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun .
It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels .
Like books , clothes , toothbrush , etc . And it was great .
And when I returned it looked like this .
Yeah ? I would actually prefer to do it more this way .
Some people would make apple pie out of it .
Or you could go into three-dimensional art .
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim .
Here I just brought it back to its original state .
And now they &apos;re all in here .
I mean , it &apos;s &quot; the future we will create . &quot;
This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel .
Of course , they &apos;re not gone . They &apos;re all here .
I just piled them up .
And then maybe before I leave you ...
Thank you very much .
Ruby Wax : What &apos;s so funny about mental illness ?
You . Yeah .
You know who you are .
Actually , that whole row isn &apos;t right .
So how did it start ?
What am I going to talk about ? Okay .
&quot; Run like the wind , Veruca ! Run ! &quot;
Perk up .
Because I didn &apos;t think of that .
Oh , and that &apos;s not even the tip of the iceberg .
Here we go .
This little baby has a lot of horsepower .
Go figure .
We are not equipped for the 21st century .
Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you .
So kitty cat , meow , happy happy happy , human beings , screwed .
Completely and utterly -- so , screwed .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Daniel Reisel : The neuroscience of restorative justice
Meet Joe .
Joe &apos;s 32 years old and a murderer .
I &apos;d like you to imagine this place .
And I was there to study their brains .
What lay at the root of their behavior ?
I sat down .
The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me .
I looked at Joe .
They failed to show a physical response .
That turned out to be not such an easy task .
There was something else .
So let &apos;s take a step back .
At first , this isn &apos;t perfect .
The early years are crucial .
That &apos;s not to say it &apos;s impossible .
So can brains change ?
The brain could only change within certain set limits .
That was the dogma .
The evidence is actually the other way .
So what can we do now ?
How can we apply this knowledge ?
Surely , that would be in the interest of all of us .
Thank you .
Trita Parsi : Iran and Israel : Peace is possible
It &apos;s actually from Yitzhak Rabin .
The year is 1987 .
Yet , Rabin referred to Iran as a geostrategic friend .
A third of the Jewish population stayed in Babylonia .
They &apos;re today &apos;s Iraqi Jews .
A third migrated to Persia .
The more Iran got isolated , the more peace there would be .
Tehran was not interested .
The Bush administration did not even respond .
This is not even an ideological conflict .
But some want war .
Who will risk peace ?
You make it with your enemies . &quot;
Thank you .
Laurie Garrett : Lessons from the 1918 flu
What is it that we &apos;re concerned about ?
So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive .
This is not your normal garden-variety flu .
Alright , so I &apos;ve got you nervous .
And we have spent a lot of money .
And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage .
So what have people been doing with this money ?
Exercises , drills , all over the world .
Let &apos;s pretend there &apos;s a pandemic .
Let &apos;s everybody run around and play your role .
Main result is that there is tremendous confusion .
Nobody knows the chain of command .
The rest is up to your local community .
And you &apos;ll have massive competition .
The vaccine will probably be useless .
So here &apos;s where the decisions come in .
You &apos;re the mayor of your local town .
What about quarantine ?
Well the British government did a model of telecommuting .
Nobody was processing the credit cards .
Your insurance payments didn &apos;t go through .
And that &apos;s just office workers , bankers .
The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question .
Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks ?
It wasn &apos;t flying microbes .
Russia has actually stockpiled enough for 95 percent of all Russians .
We &apos;ve stockpiled enough for 30 percent .
When I say enough , that &apos;s two weeks worth .
The federal government abdicated most responsibility .
Every city , county , state did their own thing .
The second wave was the mutated , super-killer wave .
Overall we lost 700,000 people .
It was likened to the plague .
We don &apos;t actually know how many people died .
The low-ball estimate is 35 million .
So are we ready ?
As a nation , no we &apos;re not .
What mask works , what mask doesn &apos;t work .
How many masks do you need ?
The Institute of Medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s rational .
And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put .
Otherwise you &apos;re in trouble .
I could give you a bunch of flip , this , that , and the other .
But I would say that honestly we don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s a very complicated ecology .
Audience member : What kind of triggers are you looking for ?
You know way more than any of us .
Can you talk about that ?
But we do not completely understand why .
The mechanism isn &apos;t clear .
I &apos;m thinking dipstick .
But we don &apos;t really know .
We &apos;ve never seen anything even remotely like this before . &quot;
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs .
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is Vannevar Bush .
And the article was called &quot; As We May Think . &quot;
The brain works by association .
Now this was in 1945 .
And nobody knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was invented .
And he proposed this machine called the memex .
He built a system .
The system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called .
And this is Doug Engelbart .
He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
So this is where the mouse came from as well .
So this is Doug Engelbart .
And this began to get a head of steam .
The magazines started to cover it .
And our PC version became quite mature .
We called it hml : hypertext markup language .
And he said , &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot;
So we didn &apos;t do it .
But is he happy ?
Frans de Waal : Moral behavior in animals
This is the launch of my book .
The only thing that matters is that you win or that you lose .
But why would you reconcile after a fight ?
That doesn &apos;t make any sense .
And so they also reconcile with sex .
But the principle is exactly the same .
And so deep down our nature &apos;s actually nasty .
So these are the pillars of morality .
these are the two factors that always come out .
And the other one is empathy and compassion .
And so they &apos;re absolutely essential .
So let me give you a few examples here .
And of course , there &apos;s food on the box .
Otherwise they wouldn &apos;t be pulling so hard .
And so they &apos;re bringing in the box .
And you can see that they &apos;re synchronized .
He takes basically everything .
So there are two interesting parts about this .
And so that &apos;s how this all operates .
We do the same task with elephants .
Now with elephants , it &apos;s very dangerous to work with elephants .
So it &apos;s actually fairly simple for them .
There they are .
And so that &apos;s how they bring it in .
But now we &apos;re going to make it more difficult .
So it &apos;s what we call freeloading .
This was the cooperation , reciprocity part .
Now something on empathy .
And empathy has sort of two qualities .
And the emotional part .
And so empathy has basically two channels .
One is the body channel .
Your average dog has that also .
And that &apos;s more limited .
Humans yawn when others yawn .
And it &apos;s related to empathy .
It activates the same areas in the brain .
So it is connected .
And consolation behavior , it &apos;s empathy driven .
Now we did a very simple experiment .
And so that &apos;s how they live .
So this is a study we did with Vicky Horner .
So they have a whole bucket full of them .
And they have to pick one of the two colors .
You will see how that goes .
The one on the left walks away because she knows already .
that this is not a good test for her .
Then the next one is the pro-social token .
So the one who makes the choices always gets a reward .
So it doesn &apos;t matter whatsoever .
And she should actually be choosing blindly .
So this is the 50 percent line that &apos;s the random expectation .
And so this became a very famous study .
And we did that originally with capuchin monkeys .
And there &apos;s a very simple task that they need to do .
So that &apos;s the experiment we did .
The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber .
The one on the right is the one who gets grapes .
The first piece she eats .
So she gives a rock to us . That &apos;s the task .
And that &apos;s what she does .
And she gets a grape and she eats it .
The other one sees that .
She tests a rock now against the wall .
She needs to give it to us .
And she gets cucumber again .
They didn &apos;t like this at all .
So let me summarize .
I believe there &apos;s an evolved morality .
And I thank you for your attention .
Bertrand Piccard : My solar-powered adventure
And on the other side there was a rising sun .
And we have to resist to the changes .
We have to keep everything under control .
Well , the unknown is part of life .
How do we steer a balloon ?
But how do we do that ?
Sand , water , all the equipment we don &apos;t need anymore .
And I think in life it should be exactly like this .
It &apos;s not true .
This is very practical .
This can be in politics .
This can be in spirituality .
Because we will throw away these political dogmas .
Throwing overboard , as ballast , to change our direction .
But sometimes it &apos;s very paradoxical .
We fly twice the speed you predicted . &quot;
We don &apos;t have enough gas to fly so slow . &quot;
And this is why you need weathermen .
This is why you need people with long-term vision .
So , we went down actually .
But we were expected to have doubts ; we &apos;re expected to have fears .
And actually this is where the adventure really started .
That &apos;s a crisis .
And actually , we changed completely our flight plan .
We changed completely our strategy .
We took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane .
We landed with 40 kilos .
I had no idea how it was possible .
I thought , well , the 20th century , that was brilliant .
It allowed to do all those things there .
But it will not be possible in the future any more .
It takes too much energy . It will cost too much .
Well , solar power airplanes are not new .
You need 64 meter wingspan .
Why that ? Because fuel is not easy to replace .
That &apos;s for sure .
That means a Christmas tree , a big Christmas tree .
We have now 70 people in the team working on it .
That has been achieved after two years of work .
Cockpit , propeller , engine .
Just the fuselage here , it &apos;s so light .
It &apos;s not designed by an artist , but it could be .
50 kilos for the entire fuselage .
This is the complete structure of the airplane .
And one month ago we have unveiled it .
And what &apos;s the goal now ?
And this is exactly the symbol of our world .
So , you see that this airplane is more a symbol .
So , we have to start , and show the example .
A little bit like on this picture here .
This is not an airplane .
This is acceptable .
It was a historical day .
Well , at least , here at CERN .
Too many questions are left unanswered .
Of course , the verdict is not definitive .
Let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to lead us .
Space-time underwent a phase transition .
And this , in a nutshell , is the essence of the Higgs story .
But this story is far more interesting than that .
But let &apos;s go back to the Higgs field .
No molecular structures would be possible , no life .
I don &apos;t think so .
Theoretical physicists always ask &quot; why &quot; questions .
Thank you .
This is where it began .
This is Los Angeles , California , where I live .
Now comas are measured on a scale from 15 down to three .
It &apos;s so unpredictable and so fragile .
And this is how we began .
We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia .
These are just some examples .
That statistic is so sad .
Fifteen percent suffer migraines that wipe them out for days on end .
The average teenager sends 3,300 texts every &#91; month &#93; .
But let &apos;s swivel around and look at me frontally .
But let &apos;s take a look behind my eyes .
Here &apos;s my brain .
The first C is cognitive training .
Let &apos;s just talk about full-scale I.Q.
And you can see here there are three columns .
That &apos;s when I was discharged from the system .
What does average I.Q. really mean ?
Then I underwent cognitive training .
This is not supposed to occur .
I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify at the age of eight .
And this person is particularly interesting .
And with accommodation , they went on to college and had a full life in terms of their opportunities .
Second aspect : I still had crushing migraine headaches .
The craniomandibular system is critical to that .
So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position .
This affected my entire body .
That tiny misalignment .
Bear in mind , there are no nerves in the teeth .
I still had migraine headaches .
That &apos;s basically it .
Using this technology , this is mapping in three dimensions .
This is an MRI MRA MRV , a volumetric MRI .
All consciousness is about communication .
This is it being held in the hand .
It weighs less than a gram .
Five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin .
Where does it go inside the body ?
So it goes in and it stays there .
Here are the implantation sites .
The main unit will then go inside the brain .
I don &apos;t have the ability to control my left foot .
Thank you very much .
Lakshmi Pratury : Just stay for a second . Just stay here for a second .
I don &apos;t know what I had in my mind .
And he was walking around .
And it works . It works .
But this is blinking all the time . It &apos;s sending signals in real time .
And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation .
It works .
And this , this is the implantable generation .
I should clarify that .
The audience is too small .
He &apos;s a very , very remarkable man .
He &apos;s done a lot of very cutting-edge science .
Thank you . Thank you .
Ben Goldacre : Battling bad science
And nobody really knows what epidemiology is .
And these are just some of the examples .
So already you can see there are contradictions .
Coffee both causes and prevents cancer .
That &apos;s what happens at academic conferences .
It &apos;s like a consenting intellectual S &amp; amp ; M activity .
Again , every country has somebody like this .
She is our TV diet guru .
from somewhere in America .
You get a certificate and everything .
Next , we need proper science , proper evidence .
So , &quot; Red wine can help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
So what we want is studies in real human people .
And here &apos;s another example .
You have to take a snapshot of how people are now .
And this is the trial of fish oil pills .
And they said , &quot; We &apos;ve done a trial .
That should always ring alarm bells .
Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design ?
But that sounds really techie .
That &apos;s a technical term .
They got older . We all develop over time .
And of course , also there &apos;s the placebo effect .
It &apos;s about the cultural meaning of a treatment .
But that &apos;s not enough .
But actually in a lot of situations that &apos;s wrong .
And yet , they always manage to to get the result that they want .
So how does this work ?
How can we explain this strange phenomenon ?
And this is the most important aspect of the whole story .
It &apos;s at the top of the pyramid of evidence .
This is something called funnel plot .
So they all cluster together .
The big trials are closer to the true answer .
Well they &apos;re heinous , they really are .
This is a drug called reboxetine .
And I &apos;m a very nerdy doctor .
I found no flaw .
And this is not an isolated story .
This is a problem that is currently lacking a solution .
We cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information .
Thank you very much .
Michael Anti : Behind the Great Firewall of China
Something is very challenging to me .
You can &apos;t just tell a one sided story .
BRIC country means Brazil , Russia , India and China .
He said the SICK country means Syria , Iran , China and North Korea .
The four countries have no access to Facebook .
So basically , China is a SICK BRIC country .
Same was true for China .
In the north , there was a great wall , Chang Cheng .
It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years .
But China also has a great firewall .
That &apos;s the biggest digital boundary in the whole world .
So , basically the &quot; Internet &quot; has two Internets .
One is the Internet , the other is the Chinanet .
In China , we have 500 million Internet users .
That &apos;s the biggest population of Netizens , Internet users , in the whole world .
How to make it ? It &apos;s simple .
You have Google , we have Baidu .
You have Twitter , we have Weibo .
You have Facebook , we have Renren .
You have YouTube , we have Youku and Tudou .
So , that &apos;s the kind of the thing I call smart censorship .
That &apos;s not only to censor you .
For example , Mubarak , he shut down the Internet .
He wanted to prevent the Netizens &#91; from criticizing &#93; him .
And now the result is very simple .
We all know Mubarak is technically dead .
But also , Ben Ali , Tunisian president , didn &apos;t follow the second rule .
That means keep the server in your hands .
Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China .
It &apos;s the entire population of the United States .
Right after the train crash , authorities literally wanted to cover up the train , bury the train .
So it angered the Chinese Netizens .
So a suggestion , it &apos;s not good to go outside .
He says it &apos;s good . It &apos;s good to go outside .
You can almost have all the journalistic elements there .
For example , this is Hamlet , of Shakespeare .
Chinese is always cheating , right ?
It even has its own name , with Weibo .
&quot; Weibo &quot; is the Chinese translation for &quot; microblog &quot; .
It has its own innovation .
It became the media platform of 300 million readers .
It became the media .
And even some of them were put into black jails .
People just use their cell phones to tweet .
They &apos;re almost like a national TV station .
But also , the cat , the censorship , is not sleeping .
Why ? Because they have the data .
They have everything in their hands .
So the crackdown is very serious .
The server is in Beijing .
It &apos;s never happened before .
So Chinese in China , censorship is normal .
Something will happen behind it .
They just give them a target window to not censor people .
Not censoring in China has become a political tool .
Social media changed Chinese mindset .
So , what &apos;s the future ?
After all , we are the mouse .
SOPA , PIPA , ACTA , TPP and ITU .
So my conclusion is very simple .
Don &apos;t let them hook &#91; up &#93; with the Chinese cats .
Thank you .
We all know the Earth is in trouble .
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms .
And frankly , I face a big obstacle .
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth .
Day 21 , day 23 , day 25 .
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics .
We share in common the same pathogens .
After they sporulate , they do rot .
We exhale carbon dioxide , so does mycelium .
It inhales oxygen , just like we do .
These are little wells .
The mycelium is sentient .
It knows that you are there .
How is that possible ?
This was first discovered in 1859 .
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber .
420 million years ago , this organism existed .
It was called Prototaxites .
Prototaxites , laying down , was about three feet tall .
All across most land masses .
And these existed for tens of millions of years .
Sunlight was cut off , and fungi inherited the Earth .
We were involved with several experiments .
Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham , Washington .
The mycelium absorbs the oil .
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together .
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
They &apos;re very large .
But something else happened , which was an epiphany in my life .
The last image we don &apos;t have .
This is a logarithmic scale , 10 to the eighth power .
Think of the implications .
as a treatment against consumption .
May not seem that large -- let &apos;s get closer .
This is extremely rare fungus .
We found one sample to be able to get into culture .
And a few years ago , we received these results .
10 or greater are considered to be very active .
Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range .
And so , for the first time , I am showing this .
Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants .
I did something that nobody else had done .
These are spores -- this is in their spores .
They gave it to the queen .
Now after sporulation , the spores repel .
So , the house is no longer suitable for invasion .
This has huge implications .
It &apos;s been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent .
It covers over 200,000 species .
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .
But watch what happens here .
And we came up with Econol .
These are a species that we need to join with .
Thank you very much .
We got reports like this .
And our system was rudimentary . It was very basic .
There is even some from the U.S.
We are realizing that this is true .
It &apos;s now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
There is so much information ; what do you do ?
How do you decide what is important ?
What is the veracity level of what you &apos;re looking at ?
What we are looking at is the first three hours .
How do we deal with that information that is coming in ?
You can &apos;t understand what is actually happening .
So you &apos;ve got a lot of information . That &apos;s great .
But now what ?
Take the crowd and apply them to the information .
It &apos;s coming from places that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
From young , smart developers .
So , thank you very much .
And we are very happy to be part of the TED family .
It does concern you , as well .
Well , now is that time .
Health to the ocean means health for us .
And I &apos;m living proof .
Mars comes to mind .
No ocean , no life support system .
That &apos;s where all the assets are !
No matter where on Earth you live .
And with knowing comes caring .
But first we have to know .
You did a great job with the land , the dirt .
What about the water ? &quot;
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands .
One-way trips are easy .
We need new deep-diving submarines .
We can now go to the Arctic .
That &apos;s bad news for the polar bears .
That &apos;s bad news for us too .
Also it &apos;s bad news for us .
The highest concentrations are in red .
But , there is good news .
Ten percent of the big fish still remain .
There are still some blue whales .
There are still some krill in Antarctica .
Imagine the ocean without fish .
That &apos;s another great idea .
And you can find them on Google Earth .
Our fate and the ocean &apos;s are one .
How much ?
Some say 10 percent , some say 30 percent .
Thank you .
Sophal Ear : Escaping the Khmer Rouge
And we &apos;re actually Cambodians .
And this picture is taken in Vietnam .
April 17th , 1975 .
But after four years the grim truth seeps out .
The Khmer Rouge didn &apos;t believe in money .
But not just that , they actually banned money .
My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province .
And in fact they were forced to work the fields .
And he didn &apos;t speak Vietnamese .
So he died actually , in January 1976 .
And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side .
And then onwards to Chau Doc .
A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta .
But for us it meant freedom .
I &apos;m happy , actually , today , to present her .
She &apos;s here today with us in the audience .
Thank you mother .
Paul Bloom : The origins of pleasure
This is Hermann Goering .
Now nobody believed him .
He painted a beautiful Vermeer .
And then the charges of treason were dropped .
And he killed himself soon afterwards .
Why does this matter ?
So take food .
Would you eat this ?
That &apos;s not so surprising .
So one demonstration of this was done with young children .
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist .
Or take sex .
So Capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion .
Now often , a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic .
This was recorded in 1931 .
So one reason why you might like something is its utility .
The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all .
So one answer was George Clooney .
So let &apos;s go back to art .
In the case of artwork , the history is special indeed .
This is a work by Jackson Pollock .
They just don &apos;t like it .
This is Joshua Bell , a very famous violinist .
And here &apos;s a brief clip of this .
he made 32 dollars .
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
So she &apos;s struck with pity .
So it was a series of five painful shocks .
The first shock is recorded as very painful .
The pain gets less .
The first shock hurts like hell .
And I &apos;ll end with that . Thank you .
Eric Whitacre : A virtual choir 2,000 voices strong
I wanted to be a rock star .
To be more accurate , I wanted to be a pop star .
This was in the late &apos; 80s .
They wouldn &apos;t have me .
And I left the room and said , &quot; No way . &quot;
And the soprano section is just full of hot girls . &quot;
Britlin Losee : Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre .
Here &apos;s me singing &quot; Sleep . &quot;
I &apos;m a little nervous , just to let you know .
Such an intimate video .
So I wrote on my blog , &quot; OMG OMG . &quot;
And I sent out this call to singers .
And lo and behold , people started uploading their videos .
And then as the videos started to come in ...
This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore .
This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts .
Stephen Hanson from Sweden .
This is Jamal Walker from Dallas , Texas .
And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts .
This is Melody Myers from Tennessee .
I &apos;d like to be the person to edit this all together . &quot;
And Scott aggregated all of the videos .
He scrubbed the audio .
He made sure that everything lined up .
I &apos;ll stop it there in the interest of time .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
So there &apos;s more . There &apos;s more .
Thank you so much .
I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it .
And the video went viral .
This time we got some more mature members .
And some younger members .
This is Beau Awtin .
And there were 900 people involved in that .
That &apos;s the number for us to beat . &quot;
Thank you .
And I &apos;ve just chosen a few of them here .
It &apos;s so wonderful to sing together again ! &quot;
Me too .
So two things struck me deeply about this .
It doesn &apos;t matter the technology .
It wasn &apos;t a virtual choir .
This will be a premiere today .
We &apos;re not finished with the video yet .
But we do have the first three minutes .
This is &quot; Sleep , &quot; the Virtual Choir .
Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you .
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong .
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship .
But they &apos;d heard some frightening rumors .
They have the same architecture .
Like all stories , fears have characters .
In our fears , the characters are us .
You board the plane . The plane takes off . The engine fails .
Fears also have suspense .
In other words , our fears make us think about the future .
What would happen to our minds ?
Once in a while , our fears can predict the future .
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios .
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story .
Thank you .
A cheery thought .
This is the world we live in .
And this is the world your children will live in .
It &apos;s already flattening out .
This is why it &apos;s happening .
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea .
But hey , you &apos;re listening to me .
So you &apos;ve got that covered .
Because the clock is ticking for all of us .
Thank you .
That &apos;s a lot .
First of all , it &apos;s planted , and that takes energy .
It grows and is nurtured .
It &apos;s then harvested .
It &apos;s then distributed , and distribution is a massive issue .
There are different types of waste .
There &apos;s a waste of time ; there &apos;s a waste of space ; there &apos;s a waste of energy ; and there &apos;s a waste of waste .
Basically a restaurant just like any other .
This is the restaurant , Acorn House .
Front and back .
Floor : sustainable , recyclable .
Chairs : recycled and recyclable .
Tables : Forestry Commission .
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood .
I hate waste , especially walls .
And that &apos;s a plastic polymer .
Now reusing is vital .
And we filter our own water .
Here &apos;s a great little example .
This is the kitchen , which is in the same room .
It serves 220 people a day .
We generate quite a lot of waste .
This is the waste room .
You can &apos;t get rid of waste .
I compost it in this garden .
A couple of wormeries in there too .
So , water is a very important aspect .
I managed to do it .
But this is an electrical restaurant .
The whole thing is electric , the restaurant and the kitchen .
It literally is Waterhouse .
This is basically air-handling .
There &apos;s no accident in names of these restaurants .
I &apos;ve got metal and earth to come .
Okay . So this is my next project .
The People &apos;s Supermarket .
Really important .
That &apos;s zero food waste .
And no one &apos;s doing that just yet .
I &apos;m going to get there before you .
The idea is embryonic .
I think it &apos;s important .
And I hope you all take part .
Thank you very much .
Aaron Huey : America &apos;s native prisoners of war
It means greedy .
So take a look around this auditorium today .
I &apos;ll begin in 1824 .
The treaties were out the window .
I want to repeat that part .
The Lakota defeat the U.S. army .
1869 : The transcontinental railroad was completed .
Also in 1871 , we ended the time of treaty-making .
We had plans .
That clause was obviously ignored .
1887 : The Dawes Act .
Communal ownership of reservation lands ends .
Tribes lost millions of acres .
This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre .
They were tired of treaties .
They were tired of sacred hills .
And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux .
So they brought out their cannons .
Fast-forward .
More than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line .
School dropout rate is up to 70 percent .
They &apos;re killing each other .
They &apos;re killing themselves while we watch them die . &quot;
This is the legacy of manifest destiny .
And how much of this history do you need to own , even ?
Is any of this your responsibility today ?
There must be some call to action .
So where does that leave us ?
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark ?
Give back the Black Hills .
Jackie Tabick : The balancing act of compassion
We all , I think , believe in compassion .
And I &apos;m touched , so that tears come to my eyes .
Because , after all , God is just .
Therefore , there should be justice throughout the world .
There had to be limits to all things .
If you put too much cold water in , it will shatter .
If you put boiling water in , it will shatter .
What do you have to do ? Put in a mixture of the two .
There is something more though that has to be there .
We actually have to do something about it .
All these three things , then , have to be melded together .
What does this compassion entail ?
It entails understanding the pain of the other .
I call that unity God .
And that unity is something that connects all of creation .
This &quot; 18 minutes &quot; business , I find quite fascinating .
And they say &quot; It &apos;s 18 minutes . &quot;
What does it mean , &quot; dough becomes leaven &quot; ?
It means it gets filled with hot air .
Then he went home .
The cleaner came into the synagogue .
Ah , what a wonderful smell . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s bread ! God , you &apos;ve answered my plea . You &apos;ve answered my question . &quot;
Takes the bread and goes home .
He goes in there , and it &apos;s not there .
Next week , with raisins . &quot;
This went on for years .
Take the bread . Take it home .
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on .
And the rich man -- oh , dear -- crestfallen .
&quot; You mean God didn &apos;t want my bread ? &quot;
You &apos;ve misunderstood totally , &quot; he said .
Henry Evans and Chad Jenkins : Meet the robots for humanity
Henry Evans : Hello .
My dad was a lawyer .
My mom was a homemaker .
Later on , I earned an MBA at Stanford .
I married my high school sweetheart , Jane .
I am lucky to have her .
Together , we raised four wonderful children .
I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years .
I handed out Halloween candy .
I opened my refrigerator on my own .
I began doing tasks around the house .
By the way , check out my sweet ride .
Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic ?
Can you show us how excited you are ?
All right , big finish .
Back to you , Henry .
HE : Thank you , Chad .
Actually , that &apos;s not true .
I would have died .
Thank you .
Alexa Meade : Your body is my canvas
You may want to take a closer look .
I painted it directly on top of the man .
There &apos;s no Photoshop here .
It was about shadows .
I came up with the idea of painting shadows .
But I didn &apos;t just want to paint the shadows .
But something kept on flickering before my eyes .
I wasn &apos;t quite sure what I was looking at .
I had turned my friend into a painting .
Why did this have to get in the way of all that ?
I had no idea where to begin .
It was about space and light .
It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink .
I was having so much fun with this process .
We got a pool . We filled it with milk .
We filled it with Sheila . And I began painting .
All right , well , hide your face .
Thank you .
Peter van Uhm : Why I chose a gun
Some chose the microscope as their instrument .
Some chose the pen .
Others work through the instrument of money .
Ladies and gentlemen , I made a different choice .
Thanks .
Ladies and gentlemen -- I share your goals .
I did not choose to take up the pen , the brush , the camera .
I chose this instrument .
I chose the gun .
It may even feel scary .
A real gun at a few feet &apos;s distance .
You could even hear it .
The Netherlands is not at war .
It means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets .
Guns are not a part of our lives .
In many countries it is a different story .
In many countries people are confronted with guns .
They are oppressed .
Weapons can do a lot of harm .
They are the cause of much distress .
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument ?
Today I want to tell you why .
The Nazis invaded The Netherlands .
Their grim plans were evident .
They meant to rule by means of repression .
Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans .
Only brute force remained .
It was our last resort .
My father was there to provide it .
He fired . Nothing happened .
He fired again .
No German soldier fell to the ground .
He could have done something .
So this story stayed with me .
They liberated my birth town .
I do not like guns .
Violence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years .
Why ?
Why has violence decreased ?
Has the human mind changed ?
Well we were talking on the human mind this morning .
Or is there something else ?
In other words , a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control .
Abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war .
It enhances peace even further .
Where there is no conflict , trade flourishes .
The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence .
Because she wants a better world .
Thank you very much .
Niall Ferguson : The 6 killer apps of prosperity
Let &apos;s talk about billions .
Let &apos;s talk about past and future billions .
Let &apos;s talk about billions .
And this chart goes back to 1500 .
They start off pretty close together .
It &apos;s based on purchasing power parity .
So why ?
This wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
Everybody did empire .
This is not a new question .
That &apos;s a great question .
It &apos;s not geography .
It &apos;s the ideas .
It &apos;s the institutions .
You bet .
That is so right and so cool .
Let &apos;s call them the killer apps .
But behind the icon , there &apos;s complex code .
It &apos;s the same with institutions .
One , competition .
Two , the scientific revolution .
Three , property rights .
Four , modern medicine .
Five , the consumer society .
And six , the work ethic .
Think of what that means .
That really was a killer application .
You just have to feed me . &quot;
But at the end of it , you &apos;ve got a hundred acres of land .
Hardly anyone in South America did .
That &apos;s another killer app .
The empires weren &apos;t all bad .
You need people to want to wear tons of clothes .
Finally , the work ethic .
He was wrong .
Who &apos;s got the work ethic now ?
Take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .
and Albania and Tunisia .
You &apos;re wrong .
Why ?
Because the killer apps can be downloaded .
It &apos;s open source .
Because it &apos;s on your watch that this is happening .
Warning : that may not work .
That &apos;s the basis for the Western model of representative government .
That &apos;s so true .
That &apos;s not the way history works .
The West may collapse very suddenly .
But one thing is for sure , the Great Divergence is over , folks .
Thanks very much .
What &apos;s your view on that ?
He was an expert in Latin American history .
That tells you something really important .
Mostly they &apos;re worried about each other .
I think that &apos;s its real importance .
Niall , thank you .
Louise Fresco : We need to feed the whole world
I &apos;m not at all a cook .
So I &apos;m going to bake bread for you .
First of all , a little bit of audience participation .
I have two loaves of bread here .
Here we go . I want to see a show of hands .
Who prefers the whole-meal bread ?
I have two tentative male hands .
Okay , now the question is really , why is this so ?
It &apos;s about a traditional way of living .
A way that is perhaps more real , more honest .
And life is really , too .
And this is about good taste , good traditions .
Why do we have this image ?
Well I think it has a lot to do with our history .
Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image .
It was a mythical past .
Of course , the reality is quite different .
And it actually drove up our yields .
That is the reality of our modern life .
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread .
But it has changed the world .
So what is happening ?
Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics .
And the world population in the meantime has doubled .
So as food became more plentiful , bread became cheaper .
We added in more sugar .
And today , bread now is associated with obesity , which is very strange .
The counter-movement says , &quot; Let &apos;s go back to this .
Let &apos;s go back to traditional farming .
Don &apos;t we all agree ? I certainly agree .
But this is a fallacy .
So local food production is out .
So we must find other solutions .
The main driver of that is actually meat .
That need for animal protein is going to continue .
So what can we do ?
Yes . But we need mechanization .
And I &apos;m making a real plea here .
So what can we do ?
But yes there are some solutions .
We &apos;ve moved towards large-scale and very high control .
That &apos;s where we should move .
So we need to think differently about agriculture science .
That is not necessary .
So what kind of science can we have ?
We have much cleverer irrigation .
We do not need to spill the water if we don &apos;t want to .
We need to think that land is multi-functional .
It has different functions .
And we also need to re-examine livestock .
Go regional and go to urban food systems .
There are all kinds of ways we can do it .
But we can do a lot more .
Food is as important as energy , as security , as the environment .
Everything is linked together .
There is all kinds of things we can do .
Talk to people in restaurants .
And above all , to me , food is about respect .
We need to help to lift them out of poverty .
It &apos;s about sharing . It &apos;s about honesty . It &apos;s about identity .
Let me share some of the food with you .
Take some of my bread .
Have some of it .
We &apos;ve never had that before .
So enjoy your bread .
Eat it , and feel privileged .
Thank you very much .
John Legend : &quot; True Colors &quot;
Cameron Herold : Let &apos;s raise kids to be entrepreneurs
They said , get me a tutor in what I suck at .
If you teach a man to fish , you feed him for a lifetime . &quot;
They teach them to go work in corporations .
I look at even my family .
Both my brother and sister and I , all three of us own companies as well .
But kids could be entrepreneurs as well .
Attention deficit disorder , bipolar disorder .
Ted Turner &apos;s got it . Steve Jobs has it .
All three of the founders of Netscape had it .
I could go on and on .
Fit into this other system and try to become a student . &quot;
Sorry , entrepreneurs aren &apos;t students .
We fast-track . We figure out the game .
So I just figured that out earlier .
In managerial accounting , I &apos;m chapter eight .
I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting .
It doesn &apos;t mean you have to get through school .
It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut .
I was groomed as an entrepreneur .
And I said , &quot; Let &apos;s go and look in the basement . &quot;
And there was about a thousand coat hangers that I &apos;d collected .
So I was just like , well there &apos;s all kinds of coat hangers .
And so I &apos;ll just go get them .
I sold newspapers .
And he wouldn &apos;t buy a newspaper from me ever .
And he said , &quot; I know . &quot;
But it was obvious to me , right ? Buy low , sell high .
You &apos;ve got this demand over here that has money .
So that &apos;s obvious , right .
It &apos;s like a recession . So , there &apos;s a recession .
I was forced to get a paper route at 10 years old .
So I would collect the tips and get payment .
So I would go and collect for all the papers .
He could just deliver them .
My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop .
He had all these old automotive parts lying around .
They had this old brass and copper .
I saw there was money in garbage .
And I thought that was kind of cool .
and making money off that too .
And you &apos;d make these chairs .
And I had these little pillows that I would sew up .
And you could stuff pins in them .
It was , &quot; Which color would you like ? &quot;
I learned that manual labor really sucks .
Right , like cutting lawns is brutal .
Because you can &apos;t sell them more .
And they &apos;d give me their orders for the following week .
And then I &apos;d just deliver pop and I &apos;d just charge twice .
And I had this captured market . You didn &apos;t need contracts .
I went and got golf balls from golf courses .
You just pick them up with both feet .
You can &apos;t do it on stage .
So I just packaged them . I &apos;m like 12 , right ?
I packaged them up three ways .
I had the Pinnacles and DDHs and the really cool ones back then .
Those sold for two dollars each .
And they could use those for practice balls .
But it paid the bills .
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses .
That was cool because then I had retail outlets .
And I think I was 14 .
Supply , demand , big opportunity .
It had our university logo on it .
Why don &apos;t you teach them not to waste money ?
And I remember that lesson to this day .
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits .
Allowances , by nature , are teaching kids to think about a job .
Come to me and tell me what it is .
And then you know what we do ? We negotiate .
They go around looking for what it is .
But then we negotiate on what they &apos;re going to get paid .
But I &apos;m teaching them to force that savings habit .
Shit , you &apos;ve missed 25 years .
My kids do that all the time .
Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it .
Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing .
Show them the grumpy employees .
And say , &quot; These ones are good ones . &quot;
My kids love this stuff .
Look for that kind of stuff .
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease .
Al Gore really would have had to invented the Internet .
I &apos;m not saying don &apos;t get kids to want to be lawyers .
Because there &apos;s huge opportunities in that .
I want to close with a quick little video .
These guys , Grasshopper .
It &apos;s about kids . It &apos;s about entrepreneurship .
They were part of the bad guys .
And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people .
Hence the violence .
Think about this for a second .
And so we &apos;re actually here to protect you .
Finally , the Sinaloa Federation .
They have professional videographers on staff .
Thank you .
Not yours , of course -- other people &apos;s .
And I came up with an idea that I will write a cookbook .
And it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen .
And I wrote a couple of chapters .
If you really want to do it you have to do it . &quot;
Something a bit more free , less constrained . &quot;
So I wrote a book on my research .
And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .
First of all , I enjoyed writing .
But the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people .
Which I think is just fascinating .
So think about these two tables .
And you must have seen this illusion .
Which one seems longer ?
Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer ?
No , right ? It &apos;s impossible .
I can animate the lines .
Brown . Thank you .
The bottom one ? Yellow .
Turns out they &apos;re identical .
Can anybody see them as identical ?
Very very hard .
I can cover the rest of the cube up .
Vision is one of the best things we do .
And we are evolutionarily designed to do vision .
It &apos;s from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein .
Or maybe it is about religion .
By the way , the Netherlands is an interesting story .
It &apos;s 28 percent in organ donation .
So what are they doing ?
Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV .
And here is the story .
And what happens ?
People don &apos;t check , and they don &apos;t join .
Now think about what this means .
And we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat .
They are residing in the person who is designing that form .
But , in fact , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s easy .
It &apos;s the opposite . It &apos;s because we care .
It &apos;s difficult and it &apos;s complex .
And it &apos;s so complex that we don &apos;t know what to do .
I &apos;ll give you one more example for this .
Here is a patient . He is a 67-year-old farmer .
Hip replacement . Okay ? &quot;
So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced .
You did not try ibuprofen .
Or do you let them go and have hip replacement ? &quot;
Very good for the physicians .
You let them go . Or you pull them back .
But pulling them back , all of the sudden becomes more complex .
There is one more decision .
What happens now ?
Let &apos;s go for hip replacement . &quot;
Imagine I give you a choice .
Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome ?
Or a weekend in Paris ?
Here are two examples of this principle .
An online subscription for 59 dollars .
A print subscription for 125 .
Or you could get both for 125 .
And I tried to figure out what were they thinking .
I said , &quot; What would you choose ? &quot;
Thankfully nobody wanted the dominated option .
That means our students can read .
Now the most popular option became the least popular .
And as a consequence , people chose it .
One more example of this .
So I decided to do this experiment with people .
The experiment was with people .
I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive .
The answer was absolutely yes .
When ugly Jerry was around , Jerry was popular .
When ugly Tom was around , Tom was popular .
Similar . Similar ... but slightly uglier .
Now you &apos;re getting it .
What is the general point ?
&quot; What a piece of work is man ! How noble in reason ! &quot;
We have this view of ourselves , of others .
The behavioral economics perspective is slightly less generous to people .
But there is a silver lining .
We understand our limitations , and we build around it .
And that , I think , is the hope of this thing .
Thank you very much .
Iain Hutchison : Saving faces : A facial surgeon &apos;s craft
And then we have the sensual factor of the face .
Where do we like to kiss people ?
On the lips . Nibble the ears maybe .
It &apos;s the face where we &apos;re attracted to with that .
But let &apos;s not forget the hair .
There &apos;s a definite difference .
In other words , he looks entirely normal .
After surgery , everything normalizes .
We &apos;re trying to struggle to find our identity .
We crave the approval of our peers .
It &apos;s a crippling time .
She wasn &apos;t miserable at all .
So she chose to have facial surgery .
He looks pretty good at this stage .
I learned a huge amount from Henry .
Henry taught me that you can carry on working .
He maintained a calm insouciance .
And that &apos;s what these people can do .
Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well .
It was my longest operation .
He got married . He had a son called Jeremiah .
For instance , there are two different types of facial surgery .
We can categorize it like that .
They don &apos;t feel different .
If you do cosmetic surgery , patients are often less happy .
They have it forced upon them .
Their identity doesn &apos;t change .
Muzetta &apos;s family give the lie to this .
So it &apos;s not simply a Western phenomenon .
We look at O.J. -- he &apos;s a good-looking guy .
And so they want to see live witnesses .
We &apos;d be pretty uncomfortable .
So we &apos;ve talked a lot about facial appearance .
But that &apos;s not good enough .
We made a model of the jaw without bone in it .
We then bent a plate up to it .
We then put bone and tissue from the back .
So the patient &apos;s life is restored .
That &apos;s the good news .
However , his chin skin doesn &apos;t look the same as it did before .
It &apos;s skin from his back .
What does that mean ?
Just imagine , I can make a biologically-degradable template .
I can put it in place where it &apos;s meant to be .
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe .
But we &apos;ve still got problems .
We &apos;ve got mouth cancer to solve .
We &apos;re still not reconstructing them well enough .
We still can &apos;t get rid of scars .
We need to do research .
Let &apos;s leave it as it is . &quot;
Thank you very much indeed .
The cry of &quot; Raw data now ! &quot;
So , let &apos;s roll the video .
Look at Zanesville , Ohio .
The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars .
Let &apos;s look at some data from the U.K. now .
It allows anybody to go there and burrow down .
Yes , certainly you can do it over here .
How can you use this stuff ?
So , that was government data .
This is the wiki map , this is the Open Street Map .
Let &apos;s now spin the world during the same year .
Some places , perhaps not as much as they should be .
Here focusing in on Haiti .
We &apos;re focusing now on Port-au-Prince .
Frank Gehry : A master architect asks , Now what ?
The wall was covered with ...
I had an explosion .
Richard Saul Wurman : Really ?
And I know the road was extremely difficult .
It &apos;s a big issue .
FG : Well , I &apos;ve always just ...
I &apos;ve never really gone out looking for work .
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head .
But I couldn &apos;t do anything else .
I think it was circumstantial .
And a few people got excited about it .
He &apos;s building this huge concrete place .
And it was late in the evening . We &apos;d had a lot to drink .
So where do we go now ?
Back to -- everything &apos;s so temporary .
I don &apos;t see it the way you characterized it .
For me , every day is a new thing .
I discard it .
RSW : What &apos;s the status of the New York project ?
FG : I don &apos;t really know .
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up .
They &apos;re still talking about it .
FG : Yeah .
Nothing that you would call architecture , right ?
I knew Craig and respected him .
RSW : Why did you want that ?
FG : I knew you &apos;d ask that question .
It was intuitive .
I just stopped .
Did you see that thing ?
RSW : No . What did he say ?
FG : He calls architecture &quot; plumbing . &quot;
FG : Anyway , the Siza thing .
It &apos;s a richer experience .
Audience : Liquid architecture .
FG : Liquid architecture .
RSW : Is it going to be near the current campus ?
FG : No , it &apos;s near the current campus .
Anyway , he &apos;s that kind of patron .
It &apos;s not his money , of course .
RSW : What &apos;s his schedule on that ?
FG : I don &apos;t know .
What &apos;s the schedule , Richard ?
Richard Koshalek : &#91; Unclear &#93; starts from 2004 .
FG : 2004 .
You can come to the opening . I &apos;ll invite you .
RSW : I found the most remarkable thing .
That was the real surprise of Bilbao .
Blah , blah , blah and all that stuff .
You &apos;re not going to defy gravity .
You &apos;ve got to work with the building department .
If it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak .
I was so proud .
I met them in Bilbao .
They came for three days .
RSW : This is the computer building ?
FG : Yeah , the computer building .
People put buckets out ...
I was clean . There wasn &apos;t a bloody leak in the place , it was just fantastic .
RSW : Frank had a sort of ...
FG : Ask Miriam !
RSW : Didn &apos;t get a laugh .
FG : No . Not now either .
and then what ?
What do you bring to it ?
That &apos;s what reminded me of it .
RSW : Did it leak ?
FG : No .
FG : Yeah .
And I &apos;ve met with some of these people .
I asked them what kind of building it was .
So four of us went .
Each one was more beautiful than the other .
RSW : Oh , my God .
FG : So , I got up .
I said to my team , &quot; Let &apos;s get out of here . &quot;
We stood up , we walked out .
I said , &quot; Nope . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re not going to have dinner at all ? &quot;
And we get a lot of that .
I don &apos;t have my own plane yet .
But let me just say a couple words .
FG : Can I say something ?
Are you going to talk about me or you ?
RSW : Once a shit , always a shit !
RSW : You &apos;re going to get one ! You &apos;re going to get one !
I &apos;m going to make it for you !
FG : No , no . Wait a minute !
Well , this is about state budgets .
The understanding is very low .
But we have a problem .
Here &apos;s the overall picture .
U.S. economy is big -- 14.7 trillion .
Now out of that pie , the government spends 36 percent .
But we &apos;re spending 36 percent .
Well what are we taking in ?
Simple business question .
Answer is 26 percent .
In fact , this is the forecast picture .
Now how did we get here ?
How could you have a problem like this ?
Only one state says they don &apos;t have to balance the budget .
But what this means actually is that there &apos;s a pretense .
So you get a big squeeze .
What were those things that allowed us to hide this ?
Well , some really nice little tricks .
The paper said , &quot; It &apos;s not really balanced .
It &apos;s got holes .
It perpetuates deficit spending .
It &apos;s riddled with gimmicks . &quot;
This is so blatant , so extreme .
They borrow money .
They sell off the assets .
They defer the payments .
They sell off the revenues from tobacco .
And California &apos;s not unique .
So it &apos;s systemic across the entire country .
This is the retiree health care benefits .
Well what &apos;s going to give ?
In fact , no , education spending should not be cut .
Technology has a role to play .
That &apos;s something I think is very , very important .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Where &apos;s the brain trust that &apos;s in error here ?
Well there really is no brain trust .
Just look at this spending .
Everybody has an opinion .
There &apos;s great feedback .
And the numbers are used to make decisions .
So what do we need to do ?
We need better tools .
We can get some things out on the Internet .
We need lots more .
We need better accounting .
It should be more like private accounting .
It &apos;s the gold standard .
And finally , we need to really reward politicians .
We just shot you . &quot;
So we need these pieces .
It &apos;s a great country with lots of people .
Thank you .
Jonathan Drori : Every pollen grain has a story
Thank you . I have two missions here today .
Pollen is a flower &apos;s way of making more flowers .
That &apos;s probably true of humans as well , mostly .
Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers .
Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen , so , it &apos;s quite prolific stuff .
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen .
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking .
But anyway , take a look at its pollen .
This is amazing , I think .
Like I said , pollen carries the male sex cells .
First of all , pollen is tiny . Yes we know that .
Again -- this time , sycamore -- wind-dispersed .
Cool pollen , though .
This one I particularly like .
And this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm .
That tells me that it &apos;s actually been fossilized , this pollen .
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics .
Where has it been ?
But pollen forensics can be very subtle .
This is a horse chestnut .
Russell Foster : Why do we sleep ?
And yet , for most of us , we don &apos;t give sleep a second thought .
We throw it away .
We really just don &apos;t think about sleep .
&quot; Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber . &quot;
Any ideas who said that ?
Shakespeare &apos;s Julius Caesar .
This is from Thomas Edison , from the beginning of the 20th century .
What do we do in the 20th century about sleep ?
We &apos;ve treated it as an enemy .
Why is it ? Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts ?
You don &apos;t eat . You don &apos;t drink .
And you don &apos;t have sex .
Well , most of us anyway .
So let &apos;s move to the brain .
Now , here we have a brain .
Okay . So where have we got to ?
So why do we sleep ?
It &apos;s gone in and out of fashion .
What about energy conservation ?
Again , perhaps intuitive .
You essentially sleep to save calories .
Now , that &apos;s the equivalent of a hot dog bun .
So I &apos;m less convinced by the energy conservation idea .
It &apos;s really hugely attenuated .
So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important .
Sleeping at night enhances our creativity .
But sleep is not an indulgence .
So let &apos;s now look at sleep deprivation .
It &apos;s simply not enough .
Well , my goodness gracious .
A hundred thousand a year . It &apos;s extraordinary .
Well , of course , you then resort to alcohol .
It can actually ease the sleep transition .
Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain .
What &apos;s the connection here ?
Ghrelin is released . It gets to the brain .
Stress . Tired people are massively stressed .
But stress is so much more .
Therefore , diabetes 2 .
So a quick show of hands .
Who feels that they &apos;re getting enough sleep here ?
Oh . Well , that &apos;s pretty impressive .
Well , it &apos;s not rocket science .
Listen to them . Listen to yourself .
What do you do ?
Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep .
Turn off those mobile phones . Turn off those computers .
Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain .
So seek out morning light .
Basically , listen to yourself .
Teenagers are lazy . No . Poor things .
We need eight hours of sleep a night .
Simple as that .
Old people need less sleep . Not true .
The sleep demands of the aged do not go down .
Well that &apos;s wrong at so many different levels .
There &apos;s no difference in socioeconomic status .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Their sleep was absolutely smashed .
So what &apos;s going on ?
And what &apos;s the evidence for that ?
Other work flowed from these studies .
So what have we got ?
So let me just finish .
And this isn &apos;t some sort of crystal-waving nonsense .
This is a pragmatic response to good health .
And I can only recommend that you do the same .
Thank you for your attention .
Craig Venter : Watch me unveil &quot; synthetic life &quot;
You can only do them one at a time .
So accuracy is essential .
And then early one morning , at 6 a.m.
It &apos;s a James Joyce quote .
Yes , in the back .
It &apos;s significant to us .
We need some alternatives for oil .
Julia Sweeney : Letting go of God
Now , I had heard this phrase , &quot; age of reason , &quot; before .
And my mom said , &quot; Well , I noticed it . &quot;
Which made me very suspicious .
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents .
I ran up to him and said , &quot; Bill !
Which was comforting , but troubling .
And this meant that I was a Libra ?
Oh , life can be so cruel .
Don &apos;t touch my hair , that &apos;s the thing .
He led them to America .
And they said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I wanted to say , &quot; OK , don &apos;t start with this story . &quot;
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
They said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s her ability to bear children . &quot;
I &apos;m just so used to that story .
Roy Gould + Curtis Wong : A preview of the WorldWide Telescope
Harvard was wrong , big time .
We &apos;re going to have a personal universe .
I think we &apos;re going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge .
Well , our gaze fills the universe .
Thank you .
Curtis Wong : Thank you , Roy .
And actually this tour is one that was created earlier .
The whole resources are there available for you .
So basically , kids of all ages , like us .
And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring .
So we &apos;ll see you there . Thank you .
Jane Poynter : Life in Biosphere 2
I &apos;ve also lived in Biosphere 2 .
So I am harvesting the wheat , in order to make the dough .
We had a savanna , a marsh , a desert .
And of course we had our human habitat , where we lived .
I mean , what is a biosphere ?
But of course none of that happened .
And it was time for us to go in and give it a go .
Big questions .
Let &apos;s take it on a maiden voyage .
More on that later .
And this is the world that we lived in .
This is the agriculture .
It was essentially an organic farm .
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes .
I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again .
And so we were working to sequester carbon .
Good lord -- we know that term now .
We were growing plants like crazy .
We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere .
We stopped irrigating our soil , as much as we could .
We had lost seven tons of oxygen .
And we had no clue where it was .
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere .
And we had sleep apnea at night .
Yes . In a sense it was terrifying .
Not me , that was for sure .
And we did indeed find it .
And we found it in the concrete .
Essentially it had done something very simple .
People , on the other hand , was a different subject .
We were -- yeah I don &apos;t know that we were fixable .
We all went quite nuts , I will say .
And everybody ran up to me .
And I recoiled . They stank !
People stink !
And boy do we stink out here .
People must have thought I was nuts .
It was really quite astonishing .
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station .
It is so dry .
This is what I saw .
But this is also what I saw .
And it will produce a food crop .
In this case it was oilseed .
They also pollute their next-door neighbors .
They had created an industrial ecosystem , of a sense .
Kyoto Protocol system .
And put your project in that context .
It &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
And in Arizona , of course , everybody puts gravel down .
It &apos;s a certain type of aesthetic .
We &apos;re very uncomfortable with untidiness .
And I threw away my rake .
I &apos;ve been building topsoil .
And I have an oasis .
This is actually in a riparian area .
The small stuff counts .
The yogis had it right .
Take a breath now .
It also connects us in time .
Thank you .
We &apos;ll start here .
65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day .
The dinosaurs had a really bad day .
Okay ?
Now , a six-mile-wide rock is very large .
We all live here in Boulder .
It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth .
Now , not all asteroids are that big .
Some of them are smaller .
It came in on a Friday night .
Why is that important ?
That would be bad .
So it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
This did a huge amount of damage .
They &apos;re just not big enough .
They don &apos;t have to do global devastation .
what can we do about this ? All right ?
This is a potential threat .
Well , what do we do about them ?
The first thing we have to do is find them .
It &apos;s right here .
But you can see that it &apos;s extremely faint .
These things are faint .
We have to find these things first .
Well the good news is , we &apos;re looking for them .
NASA has devoted money to this .
Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004 .
I don &apos;t think Apophis is a problem .
And it turns out , we &apos;ve even done it .
Comets are very much like asteroids .
The purpose wasn &apos;t to push it out of the way .
However , think about this .
It &apos;s like , well , you can try that , but the problem is timing .
Well , my opinion is , fine . Okay ?
Now we have three years to do something else .
Instead you get near it .
But we &apos;d be rich !
So think about this , right ?
This probe actually can &apos;t use chemical rockets .
Yeah , we have an ion drive now .
Spock .
So ...
This happened to them .
It doesn &apos;t have to happen to us .
We have the ability to change our future .
Thank you very much .
LZ Granderson : The myth of the gay agenda
That &apos;s when I got scared .
I drink coffee .
Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports .
This is the gay lifestyle .
Run for your heterosexual lives , people .
And sometimes I just wear it just because .
You might be gay .
It goes and goes and engulfs !
It &apos;s really quite silly , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s wonderful .
What are these gays up to ?
What do they want ? &quot;
The gay agenda , people !
There it is !
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda .
But there it is . The gay agenda .
Run for your heterosexual lives .
I &apos;m looking at you , North Carolina .
But you &apos;re not looking at the U.S. Constitution .
Nonetheless , our forefathers , right ?
He has a 4.0 .
He is starting a new club at school , Policy Debate .
He volunteers .
He prays before he eats .
Look to your right .
That person next to you is a brother , is a sister .
Thank you .
Ze Frank : My web playroom
Every presentation needs this slide in it .
It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
Do you see ?
Isn &apos;t it amazing ?
Through that , I connect to people .
And the way that I &apos;ve been doing it has been multifaceted .
It &apos;s pretty incredible -- the video &apos;s online .
Poignant .
This was a Mother &apos;s Day gift .
Particularly creepy .
This is project called Ray .
Somebody said , &quot; You have to listen to this . &quot;
And this is what came to me .
Here &apos;s how the song goes .
All right . Stay strong . Peace .
Ze Frank : So -- yeah .
No , no , no , shush . We &apos;ve got to go quickly .
This was incredible ; this is what I wanted to do .
We have to remix it . He &apos;s got a great voice .
It &apos;s actually in the key of B flat .
One stood out in particular .
It was done by a guy named Goose .
That song -- Thank you .
I heard you were looking for me . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Yeah , Ray .
It &apos;s been an interesting two weeks . &quot;
And it &apos;s sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world .
And it makes me think of this .
But the truth is life is being lived there .
And this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
It &apos;s the fundamental force that we &apos;re all after .
Sometimes they &apos;re very , very simple things .
It had &apos; Chad &apos; written in magic marker on it .
Sometimes they &apos;re a little bit more abstract .
This is Pain Pack .
Recording : Okay , here &apos;s something .
I &apos;m not alone , and I am loved .
I &apos;m really fortunate .
But sometimes I feel really lonely .
We don &apos;t have time to play much of it .
You can look at it online .
So I thought , &quot; Well let &apos;s just give it a try .
And so some really nice things came together .
&quot; I voted blue . I voted red .
Together , for our future . &quot;
These are very , very cute little things right .
Some came from the winning party .
But this was the emotional moment .
It &apos;s amazing .
So one of them was fairly straightforward .
And this was &quot; Scared . &quot;
And I don &apos;t have much time .
And I got a lot , like 30 in a half an hour .
And I shut that part down .
I was like , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
Didn &apos;t know I had one . &quot;
And I felt badly for not having done a good job .
And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety .
And so what I decided to do .
I just want to say thanks for even considering it . &quot;
Billy Collins : Two poems about what dogs think
Do they think , do they feel and , if so , how ?
Seven to one is the ratio , they tend to say .
Thank you .
You always scratched me in the wrong place . &quot;
It took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl .
Thank you .
Sonaar Luthra : Meet the Water Canary
We call it the Water Canary .
It doesn &apos;t require any special training .
Thank you .
Abraham Verghese : A doctor &apos;s touch
Her blood pressure was an alarming 230 over 170 .
Within a few minutes , she went into cardiac collapse .
Ladies and gentlemen , that is not an unusual story .
Unfortunately , it happens all the time .
I am not a Luddite .
I teach at Stanford .
I &apos;m a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology .
We &apos;re losing a ritual .
This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle .
Since we &apos;re in Edinburgh , I &apos;m a big fan of Conan Doyle .
The woman says , &quot; Good Morning . &quot;
She says , &quot; It was good . &quot;
She says , &quot; I did . &quot;
And she says , &quot; I am . &quot;
And Bell then goes on to explain to the students .
And so she must have taken the ferry over .
Later he renamed it the stethoscope .
And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born .
And it &apos;s interesting that Fildes picked this topic .
And hence the painting &quot; The Doctor , &quot; a very famous painting .
I call it the iPatient .
The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America .
Who &apos;s in charge ?
The focus was around the patient .
The discussion is all about images on the computer , data .
And the one critical piece missing is that of the patient .
This is when I was in Texas .
And she was reluctant to tell me .
She said , &quot; The cancer center was wonderful .
But to her , it mattered deeply .
I was very influenced by that anecdote .
I say that because these are difficult patients .
There was just no way .
And I began my ritual .
This is real .
I &apos;m not sure why you &apos;re laughing .
That was the original intent , was it not ?
We signal transitions of power with rituals .
Rituals are terribly important .
They &apos;re all about transformation .
I would pull down the eyelids .
I would look at the tongue .
I would percuss the chest . I would listen to the heart .
I would feel the abdomen .
It was an offering , an invitation .
I did not decline .
I percussed . I palpated . I listened to the chest .
I will see you through this .
I will never abandon you .
Thank you very much .
Benjamin Wallace : The price of happiness
I &apos;m just going to play a brief video clip .
The mystery persisted for about 20 years .
It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy .
So , I decided to embark on a quest .
This was the first one .
And it arrived , and it was tiny .
And I was outraged .
It was like , 160 dollars for this ?
I almost couldn &apos;t finish it .
I was really happy when I was done .
White truffles .
It &apos;s in the smell .
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
Yeah .
They did give me a tour , though .
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet .
It has 360-degree views .
It has four balconies .
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei .
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel .
That said , a lot of work goes into these .
But no compliments .
Thank you .
It tasted fine . It tasted interesting .
It was very green , it was very peppery .
But in the blind taste test , it came in last .
Oh , yeah , you know this one ?
This is a coffee made from a very unusual process .
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet .
That &apos;s right .
There &apos;s one with a fragrance dispenser .
The seat is preheated .
There &apos;s a water jet that cleans you .
There &apos;s an air jet that dries you .
You get up , it flushes by itself .
The lid closes , it self-cleans .
And I want to get one of these .
This was another one I could not get a loaner of .
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed .
But anyway , we had a great night &apos;s sleep .
And you spend a third of your life in bed .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s that bad of a deal .
This was a fun one .
And it was really amazing .
It was such a smooth ride .
But it &apos;s 60 years old .
There &apos;s not much of it left .
And it was an invitation you do not refuse .
I went .
It was three days , four meals .
And at lunch on Saturday , we opened the &apos; 47 .
There were some people who were a little less impressed .
And I wasn &apos;t that impressed .
And it wasn &apos;t just to that wine .
Thank you .
Sugata Mitra : The child-driven education
Well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
Make yourself understood to the computer . &quot;
So the children said , &quot; How do we do that . &quot;
And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , actually . &quot;
And I left .
In other words , they were all speaking like James Tooley .
So they could do that on their own .
And he couldn &apos;t travel , so I went over there .
And when you &apos;ve got interest , then you have education .
Sugata Mitra : I took the experiment to South Africa .
This is a 15 year-old boy .
SM : And I asked him , &quot; Do you send emails ? &quot;
They &apos;d say , &quot; This is very boring . &quot;
This is what these children are doing .
They are trying to multiply , I think .
And indeed they had .
I wanted to test the limits of the system .
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India .
I called in 26 children .
So I left them with it .
They said , &quot; Yes , we did . &quot;
They said , &quot; We look at it every day . &quot;
It took me three years to publish that .
And then that &apos;s her over there .
Remember , they don &apos;t study English .
Whatever the expression , it was not very nice .
But 30 percent is not a pass .
I said , &quot; No , use the method of the grandmother . &quot;
She said , &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot;
Just say to them , &apos; That &apos;s cool . That &apos;s fantastic .
I made them into groups of four .
Remember , from the Hole in the Wall .
&quot; You can exchange groups .
I gave them six GCSE questions .
The worst , in 45 .
I said , &quot; Well , let &apos;s try it .
I &apos;ll come back after two months .
The average score when I &apos;d done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent .
200 of them volunteered immediately .
The granny cloud sits over there .
Teacher : You can &apos;t catch me .
You say it .
You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me .
Teacher : I &apos;m the gingerbread man .
Children : I &apos;m the gingerbread man .
Teacher : Well done . Very good ...
You know , stuff which I don &apos;t know anything about .
Two children watch a TEDTalk .
They wanted to be footballers before .
It &apos;s pretty simple stuff .
This is a SOLE in Newcastle .
The mediator is from Pune , India .
I went to Turin in May .
The children looked at it and said , &quot; What ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , do it . &quot;
This one , they took only 10 minutes .
I tried a really hard one then .
Who was Pythagoras , and what did he do ?
It &apos;s Pitagora . &quot;
This sent shivers up my spine .
These are 10 year-olds .
But in the meanwhile , there is a method available .
We could change everything .
Thanks .
Gary Kovacs : Tracking our online trackers
And this is my profile .
So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal .
So I sent her online , of course , to look it up .
Now let me stop here .
I have navigated to a total of four .
So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day .
The red dots have exploded .
The gray dots have grown exponentially .
I look at this picture and it freaks me out .
And why is this happening ?
Pretty simple -- it &apos;s huge business .
And as adults , we &apos;re certainly not alone .
I move from this , from freaked out to enraged .
We can &apos;t sit idly by here either .
This is happening today .
Today we &apos;ve launched Collusion .
Because what we don &apos;t know can actually hurt us .
Because the memory of the Internet is forever .
We are being watched .
Thank you .
And some days , that can even be a little scary .
The first few systems that we created , they kind of worked .
And we have window farms all over the world .
And we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of newcomers .
Peter Norvig : The 100,000-student classroom
Just like today .
So we got to work .
And that &apos;s exactly what we were aiming for .
Students learn best when they &apos;re actively practicing .
We preferred open-ended questions .
And I like that kind of response .
That &apos;s just what we were going for .
And we succeeded .
Or , I should say , the students succeeded .
You can watch them any time you want .
So we brought back the innovation of having due dates .
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that .
More important is motivation and determination .
They got this statement of accomplishment .
So what have we learned ?
Sebastian &apos;s teaching another class now .
I &apos;ll do one in the fall .
It &apos;s a really exciting time .
Margaret Heffernan : The dangers of &quot; willful blindness &quot;
It struck her as strange .
He &apos;d been a miner .
She thought about her town .
The town had a vermiculite mine in it .
Vermiculite was in the playground .
It was in the football ground .
It was in the skating rink .
But she was really amazed .
The advent of the Internet definitely helped her .
She talked to anybody she could .
So now she had an ally .
It &apos;s lined with vermiculite . &quot;
This wasn &apos;t ignorance .
It was willful blindness .
You have chosen not to know .
There &apos;s a lot of willful blindness around these days .
Eighty-five percent . That &apos;s a lot of silence .
It &apos;s a lot of blindness .
And the truth is , this is a human problem .
Nothing &apos;s ever going to change .
Better not to see this stuff at all .
They are crushed .
Nobody would want to go through something like that . &quot;
I think of Joe Darby .
She &apos;s like you , and she &apos;s like me .
Thank you very much .
Nellie McKay : &quot; The Dog Song &quot;
Thank you .
Eleanor Longden : The voices in my head
&quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
&quot; She is going to the library . &quot;
&quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
Such fear and mistrust was infectious .
I &apos;m reading the news at six . &quot;
It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
You see that glass of water ?
Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
Now at first , I would have believed them .
It was like , &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
Strategic .
So it &apos;s not all bad .
You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
The light never goes out .
Tell me about you . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hi , everybody .
Ban-gap-seum-ni-da .
Do you feel like you are all alone ?
Thank you .
It &apos;s such an honor for me .
But it &apos;s now your turn .
Play your life , and stay tuned .
Julian Treasure : 5 ways to listen better
We are losing our listening .
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
Let &apos;s define listening as making meaning from sound .
One of them is pattern recognition .
Differencing is another technique we use .
And then there is a whole range of filters .
But that &apos;s not all .
Sound places us in space and in time .
Why did I say that ?
Well there are a lot of reasons for this .
In this scenario , nobody &apos;s listening to anybody .
We &apos;re becoming impatient .
We &apos;re becoming desensitized .
This is not trivial .
Because listening is our access to understanding .
Would you like that ?
Good .
The first one is silence .
Second , I call this the mixer .
How many birds am I hearing ?
It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
This , for example , is my tumble dryer .
It &apos;s a waltz .
One , two , three . One , two , three . One , two , three .
I love it .
Or just try this one on for size .
Wow !
I call that the hidden choir .
It &apos;s around us all the time .
This is playing with those filters .
There are many .
Have fun with that . It &apos;s very exciting .
And finally , an acronym .
That &apos;s too much to ask from most people .
Thank you for listening to me today .
Nora York : Singing &quot; What I Want &quot;
It &apos;s Monday morning .
This is no exaggeration .
The results were quite extraordinary .
It literally flat-lined .
But experts do get things wrong .
But how can we do this ?
What is the evidence upon which this is based ?
What has your investigation focused on ?
And what has it ignored ?
But we need to go even further .
Thank you .
Andrew Mwenda : Aid for Africa ? No thanks .
It is the G8 Summit .
Unfortunately , I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan .
However , the media is not telling us the whole truth .
Africa has 53 nations .
But the effect of that presentation is , it appeals to sympathy .
It appeals to pity . It appeals to something called charity .
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill .
But equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship .
So , where should we be putting the money ?
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today ?
Which country is that ?
External actors can only present to you an opportunity .
Africa has received many opportunities .
We haven &apos;t exported one kilogram yet .
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba .
Why should people support their government ?
Governments are not changing it . Why ?
They talk to international donors .
Where has all the aid gone ?
The expected foreign aid : 1.9 trillion .
Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion .
The military , 380 billion .
Trade and industry takes 43 billion .
We have 81 units of local government .
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament .
I hope I have achieved that .
Thank you very much .
AJ Jacobs : How healthy living nearly killed me
And I &apos;ve done this in three parts .
So first I started with the mind .
And here &apos;s a little image of that .
And this was an amazing year .
It was really a fascinating journey .
So it had its downsides .
But after that , I decided to work on the spirit .
Not really .
So this is what I looked like by the end .
Thank you for that reaction .
I look a little like Moses , or Ted Kaczynski .
I got both of them .
So there was the topiary there .
And there &apos;s the sheep .
And I just finished a couple of months ago .
And I have to say , thank God .
Because living so healthily was killing me .
I had to put on sunscreen .
There was the washing of hands .
I had to do that properly .
So that took a lot of time .
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council .
Well yeah , I tried that .
Now it &apos;s a little extreme , I admit .
All of the markers went in the right direction .
So that was nice .
And it was successful overall .
So I finished .
It was like something out of Caligula .
Without the sex part .
But the over-eating and over-drinking , definitely .
And I finally have stabilized .
It was really a life-changing project .
Let me just tell you two really quickly .
Because we live in such a noisy world .
And it was done in Europe .
So they think it &apos;s actually very deadly .
And by the way , it &apos;s also terrible for your brain .
It really impairs cognition .
So that is it .
The book about it comes out in April .
It &apos;s called &quot; Drop Dead Healthy . &quot;
That &apos;s my greatest hope .
So thank you very much .
Peter Reinhart : The art and craft of bread
Flavor is king . Flavor rules .
I call it the flavor rule . Flavor rules .
It &apos;s just dough that is wet .
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch .
That &apos;s what enzymes are doing .
They become accessible to the yeast as food .
Okay , we &apos;re going to start with the first stage .
And this is what every student has to begin with .
Everything in its place . First stage .
We have to develop the gluten .
That &apos;s called &quot; rounding . &quot;
And then , stage nine .
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine .
We call it &quot; proofing . &quot;
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive .
Three transformations take place in the oven .
The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust .
They give us that beautiful brown crust .
Inside , the proteins -- this gluten -- coagulates .
There &apos;s a little carry-over baking .
The proteins have to set up , strengthen and firm up .
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor .
Yes , we slaughter , you know . Yes , that &apos;s life .
We can plant those in the ground .
And we save some of those for the next generation .
So we turn it into flour .
O.K. ? Radical , not subtle .
That &apos;s a transformation , two different things .
I &apos;d call that radical .
So , we &apos;ve got now this flour .
And what do we do ? We add some water .
In stage one , we weigh it .
It &apos;s like clay .
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars .
Bacteria is in there , eating the same sugars , turning them into acids .
And at stage 10 , we take it to the oven .
Second transformation , dead brought back to life .
Or another analogy would be , a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .
And it &apos;s what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life .
It &apos;s used as a symbol for transformation .
Thank you .
Between music and medicine
Thank you very much .
On the other hand , I had played the violin my entire life .
Thomas Suarez : A 12-year-old app developer
For violin , you could get lessons for a violin .
But what if you want to make an app ?
I &apos;m fortunate enough to be part of one .
First of all , I &apos;d like to create more apps , more games .
Another is to change our lifestyles .
But more than that , your brain gets measurably bigger .
I &apos;m just the messenger .
What were we just talking about ?
Your heart gets more blood flow .
These differences were highly significant .
Half of guys who smoke are impotent .
How sexy is that ?
Thank you .
Michael Norton : How to buy happiness
We had a little natural experiment .
and fantasizing about what they &apos;d do .
So the first way that we did this .
They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Also inside the envelope was money .
So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars .
What did they spend it on ?
People gave money to homeless people .
Huge effect here of Starbucks .
In fact , it doesn &apos;t matter how much money you spent .
Describe it . How happy did it make you ? &quot;
So for example , one guy from Uganda says this .
Here &apos;s a guy from Canada .
Very similar thing .
&quot; I took my girlfriend out for dinner .
But then we see extraordinary differences .
So look at these two .
This is a woman from Canada .
Perfectly nice thing to do .
Compare that to this woman from Uganda .
But enormously different motivations here .
These are only two countries .
Or are they negatively correlated ?
So these are sales teams in Belgium .
You don &apos;t get any money from that .
And we did the exact same thing as before .
And we luckily have an opportunity for you .
You and I can go on and buy it for them .
It &apos;s an extraordinary thing .
Thank you .
Emmanuel Jal : The music of a war child
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal .
And I come from a long way .
And also telling it like now .
And also , the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music .
I saw my village burned down .
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five .
My mother was claimed by the war .
My brothers and sisters were scattered .
And that made me call myself a war child .
And not only that , when I was eight I became a child soldier .
I didn &apos;t know what was the war for .
I wanted to revenge for my village .
So that pain has gone out .
But my story is huge .
I talk about my story .
And only 16 people survived that journey .
So I hope you &apos;re going to hear this .
My dreams are like torment .
My every moment .
In the burning jungle , and the desert plain .
And therefore I was forced to sin , forced to sin to make a living , forced to sin to make a living .
Sometimes you gotta lose to win .
Never give up . Never give in .
Left home at the age of seven .
Slept with one eye open wide .
Run , duck , play dead and hide .
I &apos;ve seen my people die like flies .
But still as I wonder , I won &apos;t go under .
Guns barking like lightning and thunder .
I carry the banner of the trauma .
I &apos;m on a fight , day and night .
It &apos;s like I &apos;m living a dream .
Ah ! The children of Darfur .
Left home .
Don &apos;t even know the day I &apos;ll ever return .
My country is war-torn .
Ask God question , what am I here for .
And why are my people poor .
I was ready to eat .
That &apos;s my story shared in the form of a lesson .
Thank you .
What energized me and kept me going is the music I do .
So the music had been my therapy for me .
I hated the people in the north .
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music .
But I had this question .
So what &apos;s happening here ?
I &apos;ve been in a painful journey .
I don &apos;t eat breakfast . No lunch .
Where I &apos;m losing so that I could win the battle that I &apos;m fighting now .
So it &apos;s taken me 232 days .
And like it &apos;s been done on Facebook , MySpace .
The people are giving three dollars .
Somebody donated 20 cents online .
But that moved me .
As a nation we have been crippled .
For so many years we have fed on aid .
Invest in education .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m asking .
And now we have a couple in university .
And I said &quot; I &apos;m going to put it in practice . &quot;
One of them happened to be me now .
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma ?
Audience : Yes !
Emmanuel Jal : All right .
Big scream for Emma everybody .
Yeah ! I &apos;m gonna get crazy now .
Go save a life of a child .
Blaise Agüera y Arcas : Augmented-reality maps
So , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
So this one was taken around five .
Thank you .
Now I just made a transition indoors . That &apos;s also interesting .
OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
OK .
All right , guys , are you there ?
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
Because I want to show points of interest .
No , no . The other way .
Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
OK , never mind .
What the hell are you guys -- oh , sorry .
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
Thank you all very much .
Peter Gabriel : Fight injustice with raw video
still exists back home .
At first , we were safe in the camp .
Evelyn and I hid behind my mother .
The other soldier also came .
The other one carried Evelyn aside .
The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn .
They kept telling us , &quot; Tell the truth ! &quot; as they beat us .
They insisted that I was lying .
Text : Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986 .
No , not at all , no problem , take your time .
You can say a person is lying .
You can say you don &apos;t trust newspapers .
Help WITNESS give cameras to the world .
WITNESS .
Paul Nicklen : Tales of ice-bound wonderlands
We didn &apos;t even have a telephone .
It &apos;s pure white , but it &apos;s not a polar bear .
There are only 200 of these bears left .
They &apos;re more rare than the panda bear .
I thought , my career &apos;s over .
I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic .
What in the heck was I thinking ?
Please enjoy .
My clock is ticking . Okay , let &apos;s stop .
Thank you very much . I appreciate it .
And what does that mean ?
You glaze over with it .
There was no ice around .
We &apos;re finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic .
They &apos;re not going to die of hypothermia .
They &apos;re going to get to land .
These ringed seals , these are the &quot; fatsicles &quot; of the Arctic .
And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea .
Here &apos;s me in my office .
I hope you appreciate yours .
This is after an hour under the ice .
And so I &apos;m just so happy that the dive is over .
Which means , &quot; Take my camera . &quot;
So we had this little communication breakdown .
But it &apos;s worth it .
This is a bowhead whale .
Alright , my favorite part .
They &apos;ve got that wryly smile on their mouth .
And so people love to form their opinions .
So this is that story .
Oh , and they also happen to eat happy feet .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
This is just the food chain unfolding .
They &apos;re also big .
They &apos;re not these little harbor seals .
They are 12 ft. long , a thousand pounds .
And they &apos;re also curiously aggressive .
And we &apos;re trying to not fall in the water .
It &apos;s time for you to get in the water . &quot;
But he was right .
And now you &apos;ve got to deliver .
And you can &apos;t publish excuses . &quot;
I put my flippers on . I could barely part my lips .
And this was the first thing she did .
She went off , she got a penguin .
The penguin swims toward me , takes off .
This didn &apos;t work .
And so that didn &apos;t work .
This went on for four days .
This just didn &apos;t happen a couple of times .
She was trying to force-feed me . She &apos;s pushing me around .
And she would get frustrated ; she &apos;d blow bubbles in my face .
But yet she didn &apos;t stop .
She would not stop trying to feed me penguins .
And I thought , she &apos;s about to bite .
I get emotional . Sorry .
And I &apos;m so passionate about it .
We &apos;ve got to get the story out now . Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thanks very much .
Thank you .
Maria Bezaitis : The surprising need for strangeness
&quot; Don &apos;t talk to strangers . &quot;
It &apos;s a norm . It &apos;s a social norm .
Stick with the people you know .
Stick with people like you . &quot;
How appealing is that ?
Why not strangers ?
What can I learn with you ?
The economies of the future depend on that .
The threat to worry about isn &apos;t strangers .
His point was that strangers are out there .
They produce sameness .
People aren &apos;t close or distant .
We have to change the norms .
The range of digital relations is extraordinary .
Thank you .
Eve Ensler : Suddenly , my body
Me only existed in the trying .
My body was often in the way .
Me was a floating head .
It was a way of locating myself .
I did this in front of many strangers .
It was an ecstatic experience .
I would drive it and demand things from it .
It had no limits . It was invincible .
I was greedy .
I took more than my body had to offer .
If I was tired , I drank more espressos .
If I was afraid , I went to more dangerous places .
Some women became quiet and disappeared .
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated .
Then I went somewhere else .
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo .
I heard stories that got inside my body .
All the stories began to bleed together .
Now I am swimming in it .
And I was honored .
And she said , &quot; It &apos;s for you .
And I said , &quot; But what &apos;s the water part ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Of course it is . &quot;
It was finally being in my body .
It was the sorrow that &apos;s taken so long .
It was underpaid and really loving nurses .
It was magic healers and aromatic oils .
It was a million prayers .
It was energy , love and joy .
It was all these things .
It was all these things .
I &apos;m five years old , and I am very proud .
Five years later , an unexpected silver lining .
Thanks to Chernobyl , we get asylum in the U.S.
And in that moment , I feel like a millionaire .
Everyone &apos;s upset .
But the pizza is delicious .
And we were shocked .
But he did have one thing .
This is Scarlett .
Thank you .
Barry Schuler : Genomics 101
And we &apos;ve seen many seminal moments .
So , I will tell you right off of the bat .
The DNA is organized in words , call them : genes and chromosomes .
There is a historical archive .
But also , the genome is really the instruction manual .
It is the program . It is the code of life .
DNA is a very elegant molecule .
It &apos;s long and it &apos;s complicated .
It &apos;s not really all that much data .
We are starting to understand that .
What is the code ?
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out .
We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things .
So , we are now able to read genomes .
It was done by Dr. Craig Venter .
What does a genome look like ?
The toolbox exists .
Well , guess what . It does .
Well , actually , you could do it the other way .
And this is extremely profound .
They &apos;ve identified areas of vulnerability to disease .
So , then what do you do ?
We can build a better vine .
We could produce better flavors and aromas .
But there &apos;s an ecosystem here .
We can start to figure that out .
We can figure out what the heck terroir is .
It &apos;s in there , waiting to be sequenced .
There are thousands of microbes there .
And then we understand what is terroir .
I don &apos;t believe that chemicals are unnatural .
They &apos;re here . They &apos;re in the universe .
There also is a set of rules .
We can &apos;t make the grape plant produce babies .
Nature has put a set of rules out there .
If we could , would we ?
Thank you .
Chris Downey : Design with the blind in mind
Things were going pretty well .
As I did , so slid the chair .
Now I was getting a little anxious .
Now , I was officially freaking out .
Who knows , maybe she was volunteering for service .
The surgery was successful .
On the third day , it was gone .
My son still had his dad .
Within six months , I had returned to work .
My training had started .
It was a lot of hard work .
That was a little curious to me .
But also , the sense of smell .
Lose your sight , though , and it &apos;s a whole other story .
A lot of the information is good .
Some of it &apos;s helpful . A lot of it &apos;s kind of reversed .
You &apos;ve got to figure out what they actually meant .
Some of it &apos;s kind of wrong and not helpful .
But it &apos;s all good in the grand scheme of things .
What could I do ?
&quot; Would you like some help ? &quot;
I liked it sighted . It was fine .
It &apos;s a perfectly great city .
&quot; Bless you , man . &quot;
&quot; Go for it , brother . &quot;
&quot; God bless you . &quot;
I didn &apos;t get that sighted .
Disability is an equal-opportunity provider .
Everybody &apos;s welcome .
It &apos;s too late then .
In fact , cars , who needs them ?
If you &apos;re blind , you don &apos;t drive .
They don &apos;t like it when you drive .
Blind people want to work too .
They want to earn a living .
So thank you .
Geoffrey Canada : Our failing schools . Enough is enough !
But I am angry .
It is absolutely possible .
Why haven &apos;t we fixed this ?
So here &apos;s a business plan that simply does not make any sense .
It &apos;s not like a bottle of wine .
Right ?
Why haven &apos;t we allowed innovation to happen ?
What kind of business model is that ?
They operated 10 to 3 . They were closed for lunch hour .
Who created that business model ? Right ?
And it went on for decades .
It wasn &apos;t about the customers .
They all operate the same way . Right ?
What about introducing technology ?
I am never using that , right ? &quot;
So technology has changed . Things have changed .
Yet not in education . Why ?
They will say the worst things about you .
Every 10 years they reproduce the same study .
I thought I knew something .
You plant them in the spring .
Why did we ever do it ?
They didn &apos;t have any place for their kids to go .
It was a perfect place to have schools .
So why don &apos;t we ? Why don &apos;t we ?
Because our business has refused to use science .
None . Okay , yeah , there are two . All right ?
Here &apos;s what we know .
We know that the problem begins immediately .
Right ? This idea , zero to three .
That &apos;s a longer story .
Wealthy people know . Educated people know .
And their kids have an advantage .
But we know this is critical .
Now , you take pre-kindergarten .
We know it &apos;s important for kids .
Poor kids need that experience .
We know health services matter .
I used to make stuff up . Right ?
Because I actually like kids .
I actually like kids .
So here &apos;s the other thing .
But here &apos;s the problem with testing .
Maybe July , maybe June .
And the results have great data .
And so , what do you do ?
You go on vacation .
You come back from vacation .
You don &apos;t look at it .
Why would you look at it ?
You &apos;re going to go and teach this year .
I need that data in September .
I need that data in November .
I need to know that this week .
I can predict school scores .
You take me to any school .
I &apos;m really good at inner city schools that are struggling .
You say , &quot; We &apos;re doing the same thing . &quot;
And I will be right every single time .
We can &apos;t stifle innovation in our business .
This stuff hasn &apos;t worked for 55 years .
Some of it &apos;s not going to work .
A lot of them don &apos;t . They should be closed .
Right ? Because that &apos;s not the way the world works .
The folks went out there . They kept inventing .
We &apos;ve got to give them all of these opportunities .
We have run out of time .
What is five billion dollars to the United States ?
How many trillions ?
Thank you all very much . Thank you .
A hundred percent of them went to college .
This year &apos;s seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school .
We &apos;d better get that other seven percent .
So that &apos;s just how this goes .
What are you talking about that you want to leave school ?
And you &apos;re not coming back here . &quot;
Well , that matters to kids , and it helps get them through .
JL : Well , thank you Dr. Canada .
Sanjay Dastoor : A skateboard , with a boost
So we built something .
I &apos;ve got some of the pieces in my pocket here .
So this is the motor .
These are from remote control airplanes .
It &apos;s incredible just how light this thing is .
Thank you .
Bunker Roy : Learning from a barefoot movement
I &apos;d like to take you to another world .
The whole world was laid out for me .
Everything was at my feet .
I could do nothing wrong .
It changed my life .
Mother went into a coma .
&quot; What is this ?
I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I &apos;ve got the best eduction .
It made me think .
And I wanted to give something back in my own way . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
No job , no money , no security , no prospect . &quot;
&quot; Dig wells for five years ?
I went to this village for the first time .
I said , &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; You failed in your exam ? &quot;
I said , &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
Is there something wrong with you you &apos;re not telling us ? &quot;
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a dignity of labor .
Who is a professional ?
A water diviner is a professional .
A traditional midwife is a professional .
A traditional bone setter is a professional .
These are professionals all over the world .
There are no contracts , no written contracts .
And no one can get more than $ 100 a month .
It doesn &apos;t matter if you fail .
Battered , bruised , you start again .
150 people lived there , worked there .
Not even worth it .
No water , rocky soil . &quot;
I was in a bit of a spot .
This is what it looks like today .
This is waterproofing the roof . &quot;
But it actually doesn &apos;t leak .
Since 1986 , it hasn &apos;t leaked .
All the power comes from the sun .
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof .
She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children .
Very little water is wasted .
This is what we teach in the night schools .
But all the schools are solar-lit .
The prime minister is 12 years old .
First time ever going out of her village .
Never seen Sweden .
Wasn &apos;t dazzled at all by what was happening .
Puppets is the way we communicate .
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old .
He &apos;s my doctor . He &apos;s my lawyer .
He &apos;s my donor .
The attendance must not drop . &quot;
Went to Afghanistan .
What &apos;s the best way of communicating in the world today ?
Television ? No .
Telegraph ? No .
Telephone ? No .
Tell a woman .
Of course , the women were much more intelligent than the men .
Sign language .
You don &apos;t choose the written word .
You don &apos;t choose the spoken word .
You use sign language .
This woman is an extraordinary grandmother .
And they haven &apos;t collapsed .
He didn &apos;t know .
We went to Africa , and we did the same thing .
But their body language is great .
&quot; Where did they go ? &quot; &quot; Went to India and back . &quot;
Went straight to the president .
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
I said , &quot; I can &apos;t , Mr. President .
But they will . The grandmothers will . &quot;
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone .
Went to this village .
I knew which woman I would like to take .
I said , &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot;
&quot; Difficult husband ; not possible . &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah , she is very beautiful . &quot;
That was his biggest fear .
&quot; Oh , somewhere . It doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;
Success story .
Look for solutions within .
They &apos;re all over the world .
Don &apos;t even worry .
They have all the solutions in the world .
Thank you .
Peter Haas : Haiti &apos;s disaster of engineering
I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype .
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance .
We inspected schools and private residencies .
We inspected medical centers and food warehouses .
We inspected government buildings .
This is the Ministry of Justice .
Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives .
There is nothing here that we don &apos;t know .
Now there &apos;s a solution to all these problems .
And we know how to build properly .
What was the difference between Chile and Haiti ?
It won &apos;t cost us any more to do it the right way . &quot;
And they redid that building .
Now there are many groups doing this .
Marcus Byrne : The dance of the dung beetle
They are grown completely in a ball of dung .
So , according to dung beetles , dung is pretty good .
So the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort .
Its head is down . It &apos;s walking backwards .
This is Africa . It &apos;s hot .
What are they doing ? And there was a cue that was available to us .
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun .
And look at what the beetle does .
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them .
How are they doing it ? Well , they &apos;re rolling them in a straight line .
How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line ?
That was what was of interest to us next .
So what are they doing when they do this dance ?
And see what his response is .
And you see him do it again .
And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior .
So what we did was design a couple of arenas .
one was hot , one was cold .
We shaded this one . We left that one hot .
So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade .
It &apos;s about the same as yours and mine .
And what &apos;s of interest here is that little brain is quite cool .
But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment , look at the temperature of the soil .
It &apos;s up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade .
Watch how often the beetle dances .
And look at its front legs . They &apos;re roaringly hot .
So we described these as cool boots .
It &apos;s from a genus called Pachysoma .
Can you spot the difference ?
So here &apos;s our cunning experimenter .
The forage has been displaced to a new position .
So there he is there .
He &apos;s about to head home , and look what happens .
Shame .
It hasn &apos;t a clue .
We don &apos;t know yet what dung beetles use .
Thank you .
Ron Gutman : The hidden power of smiling
Raise your hand if you do . Oh , wow .
You ask , why ?
Please , don &apos;t try this at home .
That &apos;s like 25 grand a smile .
It &apos;s not bad .
There &apos;s something that I &apos;d like you to see .
The entire accident is caught on camera .
I would have stopped to help . &quot;
Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you .
And the answer is , yes we can .
The heart , of course , you felt .
You felt the empathy for that child .
It does help us to put perspective on our situation .
But you don &apos;t have to be a billionaire .
Toby himself does better than that .
His name is Matt Weiger .
So let &apos;s talk about effectiveness .
That &apos;s a good thing to do , right ?
There &apos;s many possibilities .
I don &apos;t really believe it is .
It &apos;s been something fulfilling to me .
Why was he recovering from surgery ?
There &apos;s about 100 people each year in the U.S.
Thank you .
Can &apos;t we make better stoves ?
And so this is what they do .
But this device was very slow .
So it was a little discouraging to the students .
So we did this . We went down to Haiti .
And these are the briquettes that we made .
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area .
And so we were very happy , thus far .
So this is where we &apos;re also moving ahead with our charcoal project .
So we can pass these around .
They can generate income from this .
These are the solutions that we need to find .
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
We shouldn &apos;t be doing it from outside .
Thank you .
We &apos;re also looking at low-cost water treatment systems .
Paula Johnson : His and hers … healthcare
Her apartment was an oasis .
She loved life .
She no longer worked or traveled .
She no longer danced .
There were no more coffee times .
Her care became all-consuming for our family .
My grandmother had depression .
And back then , so little was known about depression .
Today , we know that every cell has a sex .
Now , that &apos;s a term coined by the Institute of Medicine .
It means that we &apos;re different across all of our organs .
From our brains to our hearts , our lungs , our joints .
But then in 1993 , the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law .
And in many ways , the law has worked .
And we &apos;re leaving it to chance in two ways .
We are just not doing enough .
Let &apos;s start with heart disease .
This is the face of heart disease .
Her doctor did the gold standard test : a cardiac catheterization .
It showed no blockages .
Linda &apos;s symptoms continued .
She had to stop working .
And that &apos;s when she found us .
The typical male disease looks like this .
There &apos;s a discrete blockage or stenosis .
Now , Linda received the right treatment .
But Linda was lucky .
She found us , we found her disease .
But for too many women , that &apos;s not the case .
We have the tools .
We have the technology to make the diagnosis .
But it &apos;s all too often that these sex diffferences are overlooked .
So what about treatment ?
What a lost opportunity .
All three were nonsmokers .
Now , here are some clues .
And these genes are activated mainly by estrogen .
This led them to ask the question : Well , why ?
So let &apos;s go back to depression .
You can actually see the difference .
We know that every cell has a sex .
We know that these differences are often overlooked .
Or if we analyzed our data by sex .
That &apos;s her legacy .
Thank you .
Robert Gupta + Joshua Roman : On violon and cello , &quot; Passacaglia &quot;
Basking sharks are awesome creatures . They are just magnificent .
They grow 10 meters long .
Some say bigger .
They might weigh up to two tons .
Some say up to five tons .
They &apos;re the second largest fish in the world .
They &apos;re fantastic creatures .
So they were incredibly important animals .
This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island .
And sharks used to come into the bay .
It would often drown and suffocate .
We &apos;re often all frightened of sharks thanks to &quot; Jaws . &quot;
&quot; Liabhan mor , &quot; suggesting a big animal .
And that &apos;s a lovely , evocative name .
They &apos;re not protected in Ireland .
We know very little about them .
Go up in your boat and tag the shark .
And we were very effective .
But it &apos;s a very simple and easy technique .
These are archival tags .
So what they do is they store the data .
And of course , sharks , fish , are underwater most of the time .
And you have to kind of reconstruct the path .
And here &apos;s a couple of maps that we &apos;ve done .
But in actual fact , they &apos;re obviously crossing the Equator as well .
Were there subpopulations ?
So it doesn &apos;t really make sense at all .
They all basically seem the same .
That &apos;s it .
8,000 animals in the world .
You &apos;re thinking , &quot; That &apos;s just ridiculous . No way . &quot;
I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t believe it .
And some are caught in nets , in trawls .
And they actually did get a fine for that .
So I tried that , I tried many techniques .
There was no way we were going to get a sample from that .
So that wasn &apos;t going to work .
So I scraped it off .
And I said , &quot; You might try that . &quot;
And they sat on it for months actually .
It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man .
And so he was all very excited .
So we thought , okay , we &apos;re going to try to get out and get some slime .
And you rarely see them .
So we were desperate .
And here it is .
Look at that lovely , black shark slime .
And they are caught and they are on the market .
You want to learn as much as you can .
And keep an eye out for sharks .
So thank you and thank you for listening .
Jean-Baptiste Michel + Erez Lieberman Aiden : What we learned from 5 million books
And we cogitated about this for about four years .
And we came to a startling conclusion .
This is very , very low .
This is extremely practical , but not so awesome .
They have digitized millions of books .
That &apos;s very practical and extremely awesome .
Since time immemorial , there have been authors .
These authors have been striving to write books .
We &apos;re going to try science . &quot;
So take for instance &quot; A gleam of happiness . &quot;
What do they tell us ?
Let me give you an example .
And so I might say , &quot; Yesterday , I throve . &quot;
Alternatively , I could say , &quot; Yesterday , I thrived . &quot;
Well which one should I use ?
How to know ?
What should I do ? &quot;
So now what I &apos;m just going to show you is raw data .
Now this is just two out of two billion rows .
For instance , this one .
In 1700 , in 1800 , in 1900 , no one cared .
People were walking around obsessed .
And just like that , the bubble burst .
We can say , &quot; Well how fast does the bubble burst ? &quot;
And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely .
We are losing interest in the past more rapidly .
But guess what , nobody will really care .
Here &apos;s a simple way to do it .
So that &apos;s sort of what we expect .
EL So culturomics is what we call this method .
It &apos;s kind of like genomics .
Culturomics is similar .
Why can everyone do it ?
We have to make this available for people . &quot;
So what happened is , of course , this is just a mistake .
This person was interested in the history of frustration .
There &apos;s various types of frustration .
Google has started to digitize 15 million books .
Thank you very much .
Peter Eigen : How to expose the corrupt
Let me talk about my own experience .
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries .
Now , these suppliers were our big companies .
In Germany , foreign bribery was allowed .
It was even tax-deductible .
Not all of them , but most of them .
We will lose to the French , we will lose to the Swedes , we &apos;ll lose to the Japanese . &quot;
Many of them didn &apos;t want to bribe .
This is what these other cultures demand .
They even applaud it .
Cabinet ministers would admit this .
We had a longer-term time perspective .
And that &apos;s why the law has changed .
This case , they are not prosecuting in the UK .
We are , Germany , is not ratifying .
I see my time is ticking .
Not all civil society organizations are good .
The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO .
They have to have a much more transparent financial governance .
Thank you .
Willie Smits : How to restore a rainforest
Of course , the cage was salvaged .
This is Uce .
No . No . No . Wrong .
And these are horrible images .
No . Everyone should be able to follow this .
There &apos;s nothing left -- just a bit of grass there .
There was a huge amount of crime .
There was no agricultural productivity left .
This was like a biological desert .
We have 30 species of reptiles .
But we saw the same thing .
There are no trees left .
So how &apos;s this possible ?
Now in this recipe you also have the cost .
You also know how much labor is needed .
It exudes &#91; unclear &#93; -like compounds from the roots .
So beautiful . What a theory .
But is it really that easy ?
This is an area of about 50 million hectares .
January .
February .
March .
April .
May .
We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months .
So how to break that cycle ?
Fire is the biggest problem .
This is what it looked like for three months .
But also your legal side needs to be in very good order .
And this forest is quite different .
And they become like nutrient pumps .
And we do a lot of work here .
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space .
It &apos;s only a small part of the area .
The nursery , in here , is quite different .
165 .
Can you imagine ?
So this is after one year .
And this is after two years .
Air humidity is up 10 percent .
Cloud cover -- I &apos;m going to show it to you -- is up .
Rainfall is up .
And all these species and income .
We actually have it already with Google Earth .
So this is the Samboja Lestari area .
And look at these images .
I &apos;ll just run them very quickly through .
So you can actually change the climate .
We have our farmer schools .
This is how it looks .
All the seeds get eaten .
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like .
They have enough income for three families .
There is no simple one recipe for one place .
Ken Robinson : How schools kill creativity
I &apos;ve been blown away by the whole thing .
In fact , I &apos;m leaving .
You &apos;re not asked .
Like religion , and money and other things .
Thank you . That was it , by the way .
Thank you very much . So , 15 minutes left .
Well , I was born ... no .
And the girl said , &quot; I &apos;m drawing a picture of God . &quot;
Do you remember the story ? No , it was big .
We considered this to be one of the lead parts .
They just switched , that was it .
And the second boy said , &quot; I bring you myrrh . &quot;
And the third boy said , &quot; Frank sent this . &quot;
Am I right ? They &apos;re not frightened of being wrong .
They have become frightened of being wrong .
And we run our companies like this , by the way .
So why is this ?
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago .
He &apos;d known her for a month .
Every one . Doesn &apos;t matter where you go .
You &apos;d think it would be otherwise , but it isn &apos;t .
Everywhere on Earth .
Why not ? I think this is rather important .
I think math is very important , but so is dance .
And slightly to one side .
They &apos;re the people who come out the top .
They &apos;re disembodied , you know , in a kind of literal way .
Now our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability .
And there &apos;s a reason .
They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas .
And I think we can &apos;t afford to go on that way .
If you didn &apos;t have a job it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t want one .
And I didn &apos;t want one , frankly .
It &apos;s a process of academic inflation .
We know three things about intelligence .
We think in abstract terms , we think in movement .
Secondly , intelligence is dynamic .
The brain isn &apos;t divided into compartments .
Because you are , aren &apos;t you ?
It wasn &apos;t an available condition .
Take her to a dance school . &quot;
I said , &quot; What happened ? &quot;
And for the future , it won &apos;t serve us .
And he &apos;s right .
What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination .
The hidden beauty of pollination
It &apos;s great being here at TED .
It &apos;s like the canary in the coalmine .
If they disappear , so do we .
And they &apos;d say , &quot; Well , because they want to survive . &quot;
I go , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Well , in order to reproduce . &quot;
&quot; Well , why ? &quot;
Everything in the universe wears out . &quot;
And that blew my mind .
Here are some images from the film .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
You &apos;re also talking about baseball .
A glove or a catcher &apos;s mitt is a condom .
This baseball model is incredibly problematic .
It &apos;s sexist . It &apos;s heterosexist .
It &apos;s competitive . It &apos;s goal-directed .
So we need a new model .
I &apos;m here today to offer you that new model .
And it &apos;s based on pizza .
So let &apos;s do this .
So when do you play baseball ?
It &apos;s not exactly your choice .
That &apos;s just not the way it happens .
That &apos;s usually a sign to the boy .
That &apos;s often given to the girl .
It &apos;s competitive .
We &apos;re not playing with each other .
We &apos;re playing against each other .
Everybody knows the rules .
You just take your position and play the game .
But when do you have pizza ?
Well , you have pizza when you &apos;re hungry for pizza .
It starts with an internal sense , an internal desire , or a need .
&quot; Huh . I could go for some pizza . &quot;
And because it &apos;s an internal desire , we actually have some sense of control over that .
You talk about it .
You talk about what you want .
You talk about what you like .
You may even negotiate it .
&quot; How do you feel about pepperoni ? &quot;
&quot; Not so much , I &apos;m kind of a mushroom guy myself . &quot;
&quot; Well , maybe we can go half and half . &quot;
&quot; Or maybe something a little more adventurous ? &quot;
You can &apos;t hit the ball and run to right field .
That doesn &apos;t work .
No .
Okay , but what about pizza ?
There are a million different kinds of pizza .
There &apos;s a million different toppings .
There &apos;s a million different ways to eat pizza .
And none of them are wrong . They &apos;re different .
And lastly , what &apos;s the expected outcome of baseball ?
Well , in baseball , you play to win .
You score as many runs as you can .
But what about pizza ?
And we get to decide when we feel satisfied .
If we &apos;re still hungry , we might have some more .
If you eat too much , though , you just feel gross .
And those young people become older people .
They &apos;re all exclamation points .
But under the pizza model , they &apos;re questions .
And who gets to answer those questions ?
You do . I do .
Thank you very much for your time .
Auret van Heerden : Making global labor fair
We all love chocolate .
We buy it for our kids .
This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now .
It &apos;s forced child labor on an institutional scale .
That &apos;s the politest description I have for them .
Some of them are not states anymore at all .
They &apos;re failed states .
We need a reality check .
We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have .
This is an independent republic , probably a failed state .
It &apos;s definitely not a democratic state .
Now , that &apos;s not a new story .
But take the example of heparin .
It &apos;s a pharmaceutical product .
A no-brainer .
The problem was that it killed more people .
And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem .
This is offshore .
And you can just look at the headlines .
Their voters are local .
They have parochial interests .
We need a different machine .
Fortunately , we have some examples .
They don &apos;t own those facilities .
They don &apos;t employ those workers .
They &apos;re not legally liable .
We &apos;ll make it part of the contract . &quot;
Those factories will probably never see an inspector .
That makes a difference .
But they are extremely efficient organizations .
Now , getting there is not easy .
You need a safe space .
We can do it . The technical solutions are there .
It &apos;s crazy .
Multinationals are protecting human rights .
I know there &apos;s going to be disbelief .
You &apos;ll say , &quot; How can we trust them ? &quot;
Well , we don &apos;t .
It &apos;s the old arms control phrase : &quot; Trust , but verify . &quot;
So we audit .
Transparency is absolutely critical to this .
Go to the website . Look at the audit results .
That &apos;s the way the system works .
Just look at pandemics -- swine flu , bird flu , H1N1 .
Look at the health systems in so many countries .
No .
Absolutely .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to provide .
But there are companies .
We have 4,000 companies who are members .
Some of them are very , very large companies .
The example , the role model , is there .
It seems overwhelming .
The numbers just make you want to zone out .
But we break it down to some basic realities .
They didn &apos;t say money .
Please ask them to treat us like human beings . &quot;
That &apos;s my simple understanding of human rights .
So I appeal to you .
Thank you very much .
Ben Saunders : Why did I ski to the North Pole ?
This is me . My name is Ben Saunders .
More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest .
12 people have stood on the moon .
It all started back in 2001 .
This was like my polar apprenticeship .
I &apos;d spoken to all the experts .
I had frostbite in my left big toe .
Some very unusual weather conditions , very difficult ice conditions .
We had decidedly low-tech communications .
There &apos;s a wire dangling down either side .
That was our HF radio antenna .
Ultimately , we ran out of time .
We &apos;ve got to pick you up . &quot;
And I felt that I had failed , wholeheartedly .
I was a failure .
The first one was reaching the Pole itself .
And of course , neither of these things happened .
The lesson is : don &apos;t even try . &quot;
And the expedition started in February last year .
At first it was pretty sensible . We flew British Airways to Moscow .
We got to Khatanga .
When the ice wasn &apos;t flat , I didn &apos;t have a hope in hell .
And it &apos;s always drifting . The pack ice is always drifting .
My record was minus 2.5 miles .
I literally couldn &apos;t keep up with the drift of the ice .
: So it &apos;s day 22 .
I &apos;m lying in the tent , getting ready to go .
This was my little bit of bio-mimicry .
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines .
If they come to water , they &apos;ll climb in , swim across it .
Some pretty radical technology , a radical approach --but it worked perfectly .
I &apos;d navigate using the direction of the wind .
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May .
Ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole .
I warmed the battery up in my armpit .
I dialed three numbers . I dialed my mum .
And I got three voicemails .
: Ninety .
It &apos;s a special feeling .
The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet .
The -- the whole world underneath me .
She started crying . She asked me to call her back .
I skied on for a week past the Pole .
This was the last day I had on the ice .
We &apos;d like to pick you up .
Ben , could you please look for an airstrip ? &quot;
I thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
: Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh .
So I thought , I &apos;ve got to compose myself for Troy .
I &apos;m supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type .
The plane taxied up to where I was standing .
The co-pilot was a lady called Monica .
He put his hand on the throttle .
Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his .
I thought , &quot; God , here we go . We &apos;re , we &apos;re -- this is all or nothing . &quot;
I mean , it really was starting to break up .
And it &apos;s also about potential , on a personal level .
What &apos;s next : Antarctica .
Two of us are doing it .
That &apos;s pretty much it .
Thank you very much .
William Kamkwamba : How I harnessed the wind
Thank you .
Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
My English lost , I wanted to vomit .
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
All sisters , excepting me .
Like everyone else , we grew maize .
One year our fortune turned very bad .
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
The food passes through our bodies .
We drop down to nothing .
Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
So I went to a library .
I read books , science books , especially physics .
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
It was one light at first .
Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
Queues of people start lining up at my house to charge their mobile phone .
I could not get rid of them .
I had never seen an airplane before .
I had never slept in a hotel .
God bless .
Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
Thank you .
Michael Shermer : The pattern behind self-deception
It &apos;s like a water dowsing device .
And you walk around , and it points to things .
Oh , sorry .
So there is a danger to pseudoscience , in believing in this sort of thing .
So what I want to talk about today is belief .
It is the default option . We just believe .
We believe all sorts of things .
It &apos;s more difficult .
It &apos;s uncomfortable to not believe things .
Our second type of error is a false negative .
So let &apos;s do a thought experiment .
Your name is Lucy , okay ?
And you hear a rustle in the grass .
You &apos;re more cautious . You &apos;re more vigilant .
You &apos;ve just won a Darwin award .
And so I think that we evolved ...
So for example , what do you see here ?
It &apos;s a horse head , that &apos;s right .
That &apos;s a pattern .
And is it really a horse ?
Or is it more like a frog ?
For example , what do you see here ?
Yes , of course , it &apos;s a cow .
And what do you see here ?
Some people see a Dalmatian dog .
Yes , there it is . And there &apos;s the prime .
What do you see here ?
Planet Saturn . Yes , that &apos;s good .
How about here ?
Just shout out anything you see .
That &apos;s a good audience , Chris .
That is , almost everybody sees the planet Saturn .
Because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time .
What do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?
Anybody see an object there ?
Here is what you show subjects .
L-DOPA increases dopamine .
They increase the amount of dopamine .
You think people are talking about you .
And we then call that schizophrenia .
And what pattern do you see here ?
You know , of course , this is Via Uno shoes .
These are sandals .
Pretty sexy feet , I must say .
Maybe a little Photoshopped .
And you see the lamp here , I know .
Because the lights on here .
That &apos;s a dolphin tail there , guys .
The impossible crate illusion .
It &apos;s easy to fool the brain in 2D .
And so your brain is fooled .
Here &apos;s some faces on the side of a rock .
But anyway , the point is still made .
Now which one of these looks odd to you ?
In a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?
And you are correct .
Now , they trade up the politicians every time .
Well , why is this happening ?
So you recognize Obama immediately .
What &apos;s the difference between those ?
And I call this process agenticity .
Some patterns are real and some are not .
But of course , Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
So we can &apos;t just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that .
Because , let &apos;s face it , some patterns are real .
Some conspiracies really are true .
Explains a lot , maybe .
We did a whole issue on it .
Well , that &apos;s a whole other lecture .
Because it worked .
So we are natural-born dualists .
You get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen .
And the brain then senses that there &apos;s an out-of-body experience .
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience .
It &apos;s just a minute and a half .
Go ahead and roll it .
Girl : No .
Girl : That would be fine .
So this is a blind test .
Kay , now can you see anything ?
Pull it so you can &apos;t even see down .
It &apos;s completely blind now , right ?
Girl : Yes .
Girl : Okay .
Girl : No .
Take a step here .
Okay , now I &apos;m going to ask you to pucker up .
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit , okay ?
Okay .
And , Jennifer , how did that feel ?
Jennifer : Good .
Girl : Oh my God !
Michael Shermer : Thank you very much . Thank you . Thanks .
Clint Smith : How to raise a black son in America
Like , why did I really have to mow the lawn ?
Why was homework really that important ?
My childhood was abound with questions like this .
And it &apos;s not that they didn &apos;t want me to think critically .
You can &apos;t pretend to shoot guns .
You can &apos;t run around in the dark .
You can &apos;t hide behind anything other than your own teeth . &quot;
But this cannot be what defines us .
Thank you .
Boniface Mwangi : The day I stood up alone
But that wasn &apos;t always me .
Growing up , I had a nickname .
In my childhood , they taught me silence .
Don &apos;t argue , do as you &apos;re told .
This was reinforced by the political climate of the time .
We had a president , Moi , who was a dictator .
Being a coward was not an insult .
Being a coward was a compliment .
What that meant : that if you stayed out of trouble you &apos;re going to stay alive .
My work was to document the violence .
I was a very disturbed man because I saw the violence firsthand .
I saw the killings . I saw the displacement .
We pretended . We all became smart cowards .
My friends did not show up .
What was making me feel this way ?
Most Kenyans did not see the violence .
It was a story to them .
We have even done symbolic burials .
So that was my story .
Do you know why you were born ?
Thank you .
It &apos;s an amazing story .
I just want to ask you a couple quick questions .
What &apos;s happening now with PAWA ?
So we package our activism and we package our message in art .
Can I say one more thing ?
Thank you .
Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well .
Aid is not doing too well .
Consider these two alternative scenarios .
But why pan-African ?
Africa shall rise .
Thank you .
So Sangu , of course , this is strong rhetoric .
Sangu Delle : I think there is a role .
We need more than just microcredit .
We need to build big businesses , and we need jobs .
Very good . Thank you so much .
I was not going to cry myself to sleep .
It became enormous in just a few months .
Media was connecting to us .
A lot of people were reaching out trying to raise awareness with us .
Our car was stoned at one point .
I was devastated .
There were two big reasons why our campaign had failed big time .
And they &apos;d be like , &quot; Our husbands beat us . &quot;
We are changing the policies .
So then we found out something which was very amazing for us .
Yes , apologize .
How do we do that ?
We know that it &apos;s music , language , and embroidery .
Nobody believed us . Nobody wanted to work with us .
And so it began .
It was a beautiful day .
So this was the model which actually came out -- very amazing .
Through embroidery we were promoting their traditions .
We went into the village . We would mobilize the community .
We soon called this project Sughar .
Sughar is a local word used in many , many languages in Pakistan .
It means skilled and confident women .
Thank you , thank you .
In 2013 , we launched our first Sughar Hub instead of a center .
But that &apos;s actually not what I want .
Thank you so much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Khalida , you are quite the force of nature .
How does it scale ?
We have been experimenting with three ways only .
There are a hundred different ways to unleash potential in women .
I would just give the inspiration and that &apos;s my job .
I will keep doing it . Sughar will still be growing .
What did this team look like ?
This was school friends , right ?
Wait , wait , wait , not doing anything ?
KB : No . You &apos;re right .
KB : People feel sorry for me , a lot of times .
But how much time are you spending now actually back in Balochistan ?
KB : I live over there .
We live between , still , Karachi and Balochistan .
My siblings are all going to school .
I am still the oldest of eight siblings .
Are there issues there ?
KB : Yeah .
Or they can get involved in the foundation .
I mean , I am not a fashion person , believe me .
KB : Thank you so much . Thank you , Khalida .
I am multidisciplinary .
And recently , I &apos;ve actually been combining both .
This is the HI-SEAS program .
We did all kinds of research .
Busy , busy work .
But also we learned a lot .
I have no doubt about it .
That &apos;s the core of the project .
No , no .
It &apos;s a little bit like termites , really .
The first version was done in Belgium and Holland .
It was built with a team of almost 50 people .
And that &apos;s another crucial part of the project .
It &apos;s an evolving artwork , evolving architecture .
So there &apos;s always a strong ecological component in the project .
Thank you .
Cancer ? Heart attacks ? Diabetes ?
So now I &apos;d like to perform a demonstration of this sock .
Could I please have my sock model on the stage ?
Great .
Thank you . Thank you , sock model .
So this is a drawing of my preliminary design .
Thank you very much .
Brian Dettmer : Old books reborn as art
I &apos;m an artist and I cut books .
This is one of my first book works .
It &apos;s called &quot; Alternate Route to Knowledge . &quot;
I &apos;m just carving around whatever I find interesting .
Or something like this can become a piece like this .
So books really are alive .
So I think of the book as a body , and I think of the book as a technology .
I think of the book as a tool .
And I also think of the book as a machine .
I also think of the book as a landscape .
sort of a flip flop .
Thank you .
And most people draw something like this .
The toast is then deposited for some time .
And then there are some that are , well , not so good .
And then there are others that are about people .
It &apos;s about visualizing the experience that people have .
So it &apos;s crazy stuff .
Do you see it ? What &apos;s common about these ?
So that &apos;s the value of these things .
So for example , Americans make toast with a toaster .
That seems obvious .
It &apos;s too complex .
So what happens then ?
Now , though this might seem trivial , it &apos;s actually really important .
It &apos;s the essence of the design process .
The drawings are much richer .
So what happens then ?
Well , here &apos;s what happens .
Really interesting -- talking gets in the way .
So here &apos;s some key lessons that can emerge from this .
So that &apos;s interesting .
And the practice is really pretty simple .
So , one example is from an organization called Rodale .
Big publishing company .
Why ? Because there &apos;s alignment from the executive team .
Make your ideas visible , tangible , and consequential .
Thank you .
What emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America .
There &apos;s really nothing like it in America .
So all these disparate projects -- -- are the result of a restlessness .
We must fight with an inventive approach .
Thank you .
Hi .
I &apos;m not going to name the things your body does .
I was born in Sierra Leone .
Did anybody watch &quot; Blood Diamond &quot; ?
Don &apos;t rush to the door .
Be seated . You &apos;re fine . I was checked before I got here .
My grandfather had three wives .
I don &apos;t think so . There you go .
Oh yeah , he was .
We escaped the war and ended up in Gambia , in West Africa .
My mom applied for refugee status .
Australia said , we will take you in .
Good job , Aussies .
In this bush , we found two huts .
An old lady came towards us .
She was ethnic-looking , very old .
She took my clothes off , and then she pinned me down on the floor .
I struggled and tried to get her off me , but I couldn &apos;t .
We never talked about this again .
Yeah , that comforted us a bit .
It took us three days to get here .
We went to Senegal , then France , and then Singapore .
We went to the bathroom to wash our hands .
We spent 15 minutes opening the tap like this .
Like , seriously .
We were very grateful .
We settled and we liked it .
We were like , &quot; We &apos;re home , we &apos;re here . &quot;
Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall .
Adelaide has only one mall .
It &apos;s this small place .
And we saw a lot of Asian people .
So fine , it &apos;s all good .
Let me say that . Chocolate color .
There were no Asians , no indigenous .
It wasn &apos;t the same as my chocolate , though . Not the same .
Type I is when they cut off the hood .
My eyes went onto Type II .
Before all of this , I pretty much had amnesia .
This had happened to everybody else .
But when I looked at Type II , it all came back to me .
I remembered what was done to me .
Oh my God .
And then the anger came .
I was a black angry woman . Oh yeah .
A little one , but angry nevertheless .
&quot; You did something to me . &quot;
She &apos;s like , &quot; What are you talking about , Khadija ? &quot;
She &apos;s used to me mouthing off .
You cut away something that belonged to me . &quot;
She said , &quot; Yes , I did .
I did it for your own good .
It was in your best interest .
It &apos;s made you a woman . &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; How ? &quot;
She said , &quot; You &apos;re empowered , Khadija .
Do you get itchy down there ? &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; No , why would I get itchy down there ? &quot;
Then they sleep around with everybody .
You are not going to sleep around with anybody . &quot;
I went back to school .
There was always the sealed section . Anybody remember those sealed sections ?
The naughty bits , you know ?
This doesn &apos;t talk about people like me .
I don &apos;t have a clitoris .
That &apos;s what I want to know .
Didn &apos;t happen .
You have invaded me in the most sacred way .
I want pleasure .
I want to get horny , dammit , as well . &quot;
Are they your new friends , Khadija ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; No , they &apos;re not . That &apos;s a magazine , mom , a magazine . &quot;
She didn &apos;t get it .
We came from two different worlds .
It was celebrated .
I was an African Australian girl .
It was all about the damn clitoris !
And I didn &apos;t have one !
That pissed me off .
I feel incomplete .
Am I going to be asexual ? &quot;
It &apos;s so that we don &apos;t have any sexual desire .
And I said , &quot; Am I asexual now ?
My periods were heavy , they were long , and they were very painful .
Then they told me I had fibroids .
They &apos;re like these little balls sitting there .
One was covering one of my ovaries .
And there came then the big news .
&quot; We don &apos;t think you can have children , Khadija . &quot;
And once again , I was an angry black woman .
What do you have to say for that ? &quot;
I &apos;m still waiting for an apology , by the way .
Then I got married .
And once again -- FGM is like the gift that keeps giving .
You figure that out very soon .
Sex was very painful .
It hurt all the time .
I am the lucky girl .
It &apos;s that gift . It doesn &apos;t stop giving .
You heard me right .
Why No FGM Australia ?
FGM is in Australia .
And she said , &quot; Why ? &quot; He said they were dirty .
And she said , &quot; Well , you married me . &quot;
This is an Australian problem , people .
It &apos;s not an African problem . It &apos;s not a Middle Eastern problem .
FGM is child abuse .
It &apos;s violence against women .
It says we don &apos;t have a right to our bodies .
That &apos;s what I have to say to that .
I am proud to say that I &apos;m doing my part in ending FGM .
What are you going to do ?
Culture should not be a defense for child abuse .
Make it personal .
I can &apos;t fight FGM alone .
I could try , but I can &apos;t .
So my appeal to you is , please join me .
Thank you .
Morgana Bailey : The danger of hiding who you are
I didn &apos;t follow along with the crowd .
I was outspoken and extremely social .
I stayed in my room instead of socializing .
I stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities .
I didn &apos;t want to stand out in the crowd anymore .
After all , I was a bit unconventional .
What have I been hiding for 16 years ?
I am a lesbian .
Thank you .
Just Morgana .
And I &apos;m not alone , of course .
Twelve years reduced life expectancy .
How does her father feel ?
And that shakes me to the core .
Could I have ultimately helped change his vote ?
But I didn &apos;t .
Thank you .
So I &apos;ll start with mobility .
Insects move around amazingly well .
This video is from UC Berkeley .
So this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side , so really tiny .
That &apos;s almost 100 times its own length .
But ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot .
So this robot &apos;s about the size of a Tic Tac .
It &apos;s only four by four by seven millimeters in size .
So there &apos;s no tethers on this , no wires connecting to this .
Right ? &quot; Fantastic Voyage , &quot; Isaac Asimov .
Or they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place .
of what we can do with these small robots .
Thanks very much .
Navi Radjou : Creative problem-solving in the face of extreme limits
Take Mansukh Prajapati , a potter in India .
That &apos;s a cool invention , literally .
The Peruvians are amazing .
They can literally create water out of thin air .
Many of them did not go to school .
The street is the lab .
Why do they do that ?
In India , we call it Jugaad .
Think of the iPhone 5 , 6 , then 7 , 8 .
The good news is , that &apos;s starting to happen .
Let me give you two examples .
Actually , no .
Let me give you an example .
It &apos;s called gThrive .
It pays for itself within one year .
How do they do that ?
The exciting news is that &apos;s starting to happen .
Let &apos;s go to Nairobi to find that out .
Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams .
When I first saw them , I thought , &quot; Holy cow . &quot;
and yet more effective .
The first principle is : Keep it simple .
Third principle is : Think and act horizontally .
Thank you very much .
A conflict that was fought during the Cold War .
We call them the Desaparecidos .
And only about 17 percent are of European descent .
Now the families , they want information .
They want to know what happened .
They want the bodies of their loved ones .
And we left .
We left Guatemala and we came here .
I didn &apos;t care for it ; it was too painful .
But it wasn &apos;t till 1995 that I decided to do something about it .
So I went back .
The way we work is that we give people information .
We talk to the family members and we let them choose .
And even more important , we let them choose to give us a piece of themselves .
A piece , an essence , of who they are .
We literally bring the skeleton out of the ground .
Whether it &apos;s a baby , or an adult .
Whether it &apos;s a woman or a man .
The best way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases .
The first is the case of the military diary .
Now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in 1999 .
And then you see a date .
Now that &apos;s going to come into play in a second .
Now Sergio was a professor at the university .
And then we noticed that he was also in the diary .
Six .
So then we said , how many people were executed on March 29 , 1984 ?
That &apos;s right , six as well .
All put in that grave .
And we identified those six bodies and gave them back to the families .
and go to countries like Haiti and the Congo .
It &apos;s very ironic .
People that 533 families are looking for .
So we &apos;re going to focus on Grave 15 .
Well , guess what ?
So we conducted some DNA analysis , and guess what ?
We identified Martina Rojas and Manuel Chen .
Both of them disappeared in that case , and now we could prove it .
Now , Manuel Chen was three years old .
But we &apos;re doing more than that .
So no more missing , guys .
Okay ? No more missing .
Thank you .
Asha de Vos : Why you should care about whale poo
It boils down to two main things : whale poop and rotting carcasses .
Let &apos;s also do it for ours .
Thank you .
Erin McKean : Go ahead , make up new words !
I &apos;m a lexicographer .
I make dictionaries .
Every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other .
So they say something like , &quot; Because grammar ! &quot;
But the word &quot; grammar , &quot; actually , there are two kinds of grammar .
It &apos;s a wug .
Now there is another one .
There are two of these .
There are two ...
Audience : Wugs .
That rule lives in your brain .
So we &apos;ve been talking about this for a long time .
And nobody has to remind you to obey a law of nature , right ?
Nobody says this .
So you can think of a word as like a hat .
What they have to tell you is , &quot; Can you wear hats inside ?
Who gets to wear a hat ?
What are the kinds of hats you get to wear ? &quot;
And I think that is , well , stupid .
But that makes no sense to me .
Words are great . We should have more of them .
The first way is the simplest way .
Basically , steal them from other languages .
This is called compounding .
&quot; Motel &quot; is a blend of &quot; motor &quot; and &quot; hotel . &quot;
&quot; Edutainment &quot; is a blend of &quot; education &quot; and &quot; entertainment . &quot;
And of course , &quot; electrocute &quot; is a blend of &quot; electric &quot; and &quot; execute . &quot;
This is called functional shift .
You can also take adjectives and make them into nouns .
And of course , you can &quot; green &quot; things .
&quot; Edit &quot; was formed from &quot; editor . &quot;
So National Aeronautics and Space Administration becomes NASA .
So it doesn &apos;t matter how silly the words are .
They can be really good words of English .
&quot; Absquatulate &quot; is a perfectly good word of English .
&quot; Mugwump &quot; is a perfectly good word of English .
Why should you make words ?
And new words grab people &apos;s attention .
You can make a new word right now .
English has no age limit .
Thank you so much .
Mundano : Pimp my ... trash cart ?
Our world has many superheroes .
Thank you .
So now everybody can join .
Muito orbigado , thank you .
The power of yet .
It gives you a path into the future .
Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way .
They understood that their abilities could be developed .
But other students felt it was tragic , catastrophic .
So what do they do next ?
On the left , you see the fixed mindset students .
There &apos;s hardly any activity .
They run from the error .
They don &apos;t engage with it .
They engage deeply .
Their brain is on fire with yet .
They engage deeply .
They process the error .
They learn from it and they correct it .
How are we raising our children ?
So what can we do ?
How can we build that bridge to yet ?
Here are some things we can do .
That has failed .
Don &apos;t do that anymore .
There are other ways to reward yet .
And we can actually change students &apos; mindsets .
So let &apos;s talk about equality .
And here are just a few examples .
So the native kids outdid the Microsoft kids .
That &apos;s when they &apos;re getting smarter .
I now realize I &apos;ve wasted most of my life . &quot;
Thank you .
Let &apos;s take a look at San Francisco .
And so it leads to things like this .
Let &apos;s take a look at Rio de Janeiro .
Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here .
How cool is that ?
And then the Flamengo football team is also represented here .
So we have all this data .
So what can we do with it ?
So what is a city ?
Thank you .
Location information can be very sensitive .
This information used to be private .
Did you know this was happening ?
Mike hasn &apos;t done anything wrong .
Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information ?
The question is , what should we do about this ?
I think this poses a serious civil liberties threat .
Fortunately , there are steps we can take .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Even the elections this past week passed without much drama .
Al Jazeera . CNN . How did we get there ?
Where do you get your ideas ?
In the lunchroom .
We tell the story at the exact time during the night .
So one of us came up with a train .
&quot; Oh , &quot; we said , &quot; full length . &quot;
&quot; Yes , but we mean the program . &quot;
And back and forth .
I &apos;m talking to the guests , some information .
Train announcement : We will arrive at Haugastøl Station .
Narrator &#91; in Norwegian &#93; : Then a bit of flirting while the food is digested .
The last downhill stretch before we reach our destination .
We pass Mjølfjell Station .
Then a new tunnel .
We brought it on air in November 2009 .
But no , this was far more attractive .
So that &apos;s strong and living TV .
We wanted to do something different .
The Bergen Railway was a recorded program .
Would more people show up ?
What would it look like ?
So we decided our next project , it should be live .
It &apos;s the other strong memory .
It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen .
They made all the stories .
This is Karl . He &apos;s in the ninth grade .
He was supposed to be in the school at 8 a.m.
How did we do this ?
Yes , we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten .
We turned it into a complete TV control room .
This is one of them .
And with some very creative solutions .
Narrator &#91; in Norwegian &#93; : Run it up and down .
This is Norway &apos;s most important drill right now .
Eight wires keep the camera stable .
He &apos;s doing fine . Everything went well .
It was also a great success on social media .
Thank you .
Some watched a little bit more .
And he &apos;s 82 years old , and he hardly slept .
This is the last project . It &apos;s the peep show .
This is from the Colbert Report on Comedy Central .
TH : Exactly . So why does this stand out ?
This is so completely different to other TV programming .
And of course this is a lot of planning , this is a lot of logistics .
You have to just take your cameras with you .
We didn &apos;t know anything more when we left Bergen .
Some of you have seen the flag .
Some of you start wondering , is the farmer at home ?
And where is that cow going ?
That &apos;s Slow TV .
Thank you .
Anastasia Taylor-Lind : Fighters and mourners of the Ukrainian revolution
The process is old-fashioned .
The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue .
There were lines of bodies laid in the street .
And there was blood all over the pavements .
The following day , President Yanukovych fled Ukraine .
Sadness enveloped Maidan .
It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing .
I hadn &apos;t heard that before .
Most women cried when I photographed them .
Men fight most wars and women mourn them .
I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago .
Glory to heroes . &quot;
Thank you .
Jose Miguel Sokoloff : How Christmas lights helped guerrillas put down their guns
But we have a few problems .
You may have heard of some of them .
There has been terrorism . There have been random bombs .
So it &apos;s a little bit like the Bolívar wars again .
It &apos;s a lot of people who have died unnecessarily .
Demobilize .
At Christmas , everything is possible . &quot;
So how do we know these trees worked ?
But we didn &apos;t know very much about it .
This person you see here is Giovanni Andres .
Giovanni Andres is 25 when we took that picture .
And he did .
The story was , they did meet .
I know you &apos;re wondering if they did meet .
They did meet .
So we thought , well , we &apos;ll use the same strategy .
We &apos;ll have commanders talking to commanders .
And that was when the Christmas tree happened .
We use rivers . &quot;
We collected over 6,000 messages .
Some of them were notes saying , get out .
Some of them were toys . Some of them were candy .
But lots of them were picked up .
At some point I &apos;m going to get out . &quot;
Their fears were , &quot; Am I going to be rejected ?
When I get out of this , am I going to be rejected ? &quot;
Thank you .
And then we decided to work with society .
So we did mothers around Christmastime .
Now let &apos;s talk about the rest of the people .
I do not -- Thank you .
We &apos;d love to help .
Thank you .
Rosie King : How autism freed me to be myself
I am also autistic .
For instance , my little brother , he &apos;s very severely autistic .
He &apos;s nonverbal . He can &apos;t talk at all .
But I love to talk .
But that &apos;s not just with autistic people , either .
I googled &quot; autistic people are ... &quot;
and the top result was &quot; demons . &quot;
They know .
Let me explain it to you a bit .
It &apos;s like I &apos;m walking in two worlds most of the time .
That &apos;s one of the best things about being autistic .
You don &apos;t have the urge to do that .
There are problems , though .
But if you think about it , what is normal ?
What does it mean ?
&quot; Wow , you are really normal . &quot;
But compliments are , &quot; you are extraordinary &quot; or &quot; you step outside the box . &quot;
It &apos;s &quot; you &apos;re amazing . &quot;
Thank you .
Joe Landolina : This gel can make you stop bleeding instantly
So the cell is the most basic unit of life .
But not many people know what else .
So now , for example , think of the rainforest .
So now this technology — Thank you .
Thank you very much .
You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a stink .
But there &apos;s no agenda .
And yet you accept the meeting invitation , and you go .
I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise .
Let me tell you why .
There &apos;s the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting .
There are the participants who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck .
And everybody leaves very angry .
It &apos;s kind of funny .
Let &apos;s take a quick look .
Hi , Joe . Thanks for joining us today , great .
It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
And cried . And I cried some more . &quot;
These are real quotes and it &apos;s real sad .
But the truth is , we &apos;re not powerless at all .
Here &apos;s how No MAS works . It &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s right next to the accept button .
People might actually start sending out agendas . Imagine !
Thank you .
Vincent Moon and Naná Vasconcelos : Hidden music rituals around the world
And actually , why do we record ?
We were crazy about music .
We are going to see a few extracts now .
My desire was to make it as a trek .
Well , or other drinks , depending on where you are .
In Peru , they drink pisco sour .
This is important to record that whole person .
This is important to create this exchange .
Are you a journalist ? NGO ? Politics ?
What kind of problems are you going to study ? &quot;
I just want to represent them in a beautiful light .
They &apos;re going to think about it differently .
Why you will record ?
What &apos;s the point of that ?
Where do we go with it ?
Where is this all coming from ?
Maybe a few more extracts now .
I &apos;m doing it with Priscilla Telmon .
It &apos;s research on the new spiritualities all around the country .
Why do we record ?
I was still there .
I really believe cinema teaches us to see .
And it &apos;s very simple .
Muito obrigado .
Vincent , Vincent , Vincent .
You don &apos;t do much editing .
It &apos;s correct ?
Tell us a couple of things .
When did you do a video with him ?
VM : It was amongst the first ones in Brazil , yeah .
I shot the film in Recife , in the place where he is from .
VM : I &apos;ll just make it very short .
Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos .
Naná Vasconcelos !
Naná Vasconcelos : Let &apos;s go to the jungle .
And you &apos;re absolutely right .
It &apos;s dry as a bone .
They didn &apos;t have data and statistics .
And now today , every country produces GDP statistics .
It &apos;s in the introductory chapter .
It &apos;s not a measure of our well-being .
Our politicians boast when GDP goes up .
But we know that GDP is flawed .
It ignores the environment .
It counts bombs and prisons as progress .
It can &apos;t count happiness or community .
Do I have enough to eat ?
Can I read and write ?
Am I safe ?
Do I have rights ?
It &apos;s a whole new way of looking at the world .
Okay , I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m going to show you on this chart .
Higher is better .
Further to the right is more .
Or maybe the year after .
Now , I know what you &apos;re thinking .
It &apos;s a good point , well made .
So what &apos;s going on ? Well , look .
There we go . Lots of dots .
Come on , cheer !
Go , Brazil !
I &apos;ll show you an example of Brazil .
And look , Brazil &apos;s above the line .
But where does Brazil go next ?
But that is only half a plan .
We don &apos;t want Brazil to become like Russia .
And it &apos;s not just about countries .
We did it for the Amazon region .
Thank you .
Ramanan Laxminarayan : The coming crisis in antibiotics
That small scratch became infected .
His fever went down , his appetite came back .
Second day , he was doing much better .
Day four , well on the way to recovery .
This was a miracle .
Now , what did that lead us to ?
This is serious .
Now , these are not separate .
And certainly consumer education works .
Now , there &apos;s a lot that can be done on the supply side as well .
It &apos;s a fairly cheap drug .
But what is that really telling us ?
So we need to think about that .
It includes bacteriophages , probiotics , quorum sensing , synbiotics .
But there are challenges here .
We don &apos;t want to just throw money at a problem .
So it &apos;s not as if these are permanent solutions .
Viruses are becoming resistant .
Agricultural pests . Malaria parasites .
Mosquitos develop resistance .
So those are also resistant .
Turns out that rats are also resistant to poisons .
And we really now need to start thinking about them as natural resources .
And so we stand at a crossroads .
Thank you .
Now , we learned that favelas are informal communities .
So we thought , would that even be possible ?
But somehow the idea stuck .
JK : We had a friend .
He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro .
His name was Nanko , and he also liked the idea .
It &apos;s when a house is finished . &quot;
They said , &quot; What did you do ?
You painted our house in exactly the same color as the police station . &quot;
In a favela , that is not a good thing .
Also the same color as the prison cell .
We said , &quot; Uh , it &apos;s art .
JK : We still had this idea of the hill , though .
So we immediately said yes .
JK : So now we had painted a whole street .
How many square meters is that ?
And maybe it &apos;s a mistake to think like that .
Together with them , we decided where to start .
This article about Angelo appeared .
DU : So while this is happening , we are bringing this idea all over the world .
DU : Thank you .
Evidence shows that people are better off in cities .
Row houses , 60 families .
We had to innovate .
So what did we do ?
This is our last project in Chile .
None of this is rocket science .
You don &apos;t require sophisticated programming .
It &apos;s not about technology .
First one : Forbid installation on ground zero .
Thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation .
So this alternative was irresponsible .
&#91; In Spanish &#93; Loudspeaker : What kind of city do you want ?
Vote for Constitución .
Participate !
Fisherman : I am a fisherman .
Twenty-five fishermen work for me .
Where should I take them ? To the forest ?
Done well , of course .
I am the history of Constitución .
and my grandchildren and everyone else will .
But why are you imposing this on me ?
You ! You are imposing this on me !
In danger zone I am not authorized to build .
He himself is saying that .
It &apos;s poor and it &apos;s scarce .
The sum of them : 52 million dollars .
It is life itself .
Thank you so much .
Kare Anderson : Be an opportunity maker
Do you dare raise your hand ?
Remember , I was young then .
So what did they do ?
What we still do perhaps too often .
We talk about ourselves .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m sitting here .
And as she was talking , a thought came to my mind .
He had workout regime he did every day .
I think she was following me at that point .
I said , &quot; He &apos;d be an unexpected ally . &quot;
I think they &apos;d make good allies .
And indeed they were .
They met together . They prepared .
They spoke in front of the Los Angeles City Council .
They were startling , compelling and credible .
You can &apos;t buy that .
That &apos;s what opportunity-makers do .
It &apos;s especially important now .
Why is it important now ?
And he thought , I have a set of racquetball courts .
That guy could teach it .
They &apos;re frequent travelers .
That &apos;s how Wally got hired .
Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers .
Thank you very much .
Frans Lanting : Photos that give voice to the animal kingdom
When they arrived , they would all take off their skins .
I want to get under the skin .
You may wonder , do I ever photograph people ?
Thank you .
Sergei Lupashin : A flying camera ... on a leash
I came here to show you the Fotokite .
It &apos;s a tethered , flying camera .
Here &apos;s one of the panoramas .
You just can &apos;t consider this insignificant .
All in a single image , which was really cool to me .
And it make sense . It &apos;s such a unique perspective .
But there are a few hurdles , and they are quite basic and quite fundamental .
One is piloting .
And these guys are great . They &apos;re professionals ; they &apos;re really careful in what they do .
So we already have cameras .
There are more and more of them .
But I think there are better solutions .
I think we have to defuse the situation .
And this is one potential solution .
So this is the Fotokite .
Well , let me see , it &apos;s a quadrocopter , but what &apos;s kind of special about it is there &apos;s a leash .
It &apos;s literally a dog leash . It &apos;s very convenient .
You give it a little twist .
That &apos;s kind of the way you communicate .
And there it goes .
So the interaction is super simple .
It &apos;s like a personal flying pet .
You can turn it on .
So I just shifted its position .
And it &apos;s really safe .
Live demos are hard , right ? Things go wrong all the time .
You don &apos;t have to look for someone controlling it .
What would you use it for ?
Thank you .
Marc Abrahams : A science award that makes you laugh , then think
This device consists of a large , round table and some machinery .
The child comes flying out through centrifugal force .
And as far as anyone knows , that doesn &apos;t bother them in the slightest .
How does this happen ?
Their brain does not slosh around like ours does .
And the woodpecker maybe relates to that .
After a year , he still smelled putrid .
After two years , still smelled putrid .
Three years , four years , still smelled putrid .
After five years , it went away on its own .
It &apos;s a mystery .
They live in a city that has huge hills , San Francisco-grade hills .
Try one of two conditions .
And what they discovered by experiment , and it was quite graphic when they saw it , was that it &apos;s true .
Every year we give out 10 prizes .
The prizes are based on just one criteria . It &apos;s very simple .
That &apos;s the quality we look for .
It &apos;s very difficult , numerically , to win a prize if you want to .
Even if you don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s very difficult numerically .
Happily for us , almost everyone who &apos;s offered a prize decides to accept .
What do you get if you win an Ig Nobel prize ?
Well , you get several things .
You get an Ig Nobel prize . The design is different every year .
These are always handmade from extremely cheap materials .
Most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash , some money .
Last year , though , we did manage to scrape up some money .
And when you get there , you come to Harvard &apos;s biggest meeting place and classroom .
That &apos;s the heart of the ceremony .
Keep in mind , we &apos;ve given 230 prizes .
There are lots of these people who walk among you .
Maybe you have one .
It was written by Dr. Peter Barss , who is Canadian .
So he went to Papua New Guinea .
And there were some difficulties at first .
And so , you want to have a larger space .
The gas that they used at first , in many cases , was oxygen .
So they added oxygen to methane gas .
And that &apos;s where the idea came from .
Thank you .
Fabien Cousteau : What I learned from spending 31 days underwater
I have a confession to make .
But they didn &apos;t test for curiosity .
Maybe you &apos;ve heard of her .
It &apos;s called Aquarius .
In other ways , it &apos;s a legacy .
It wasn &apos;t about living at something the size of a school bus .
So mission 31 wasn &apos;t so much about breaking records .
It was about that human-ocean connection .
It &apos;s like seeing dogs and cats behaving well together .
Now , this wasn &apos;t just about adventure .
There was actually a serious note to it .
It &apos;s available to every one of us .
We had never seen that before .
And I &apos;ve thought about this my whole life .
Nothing is impossible .
Thank you very much .
This time , it was different .
There were no coups .
Everything worked . Great education .
I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe and I went off to college .
Six years later , I returned to the country .
Everything was different .
It had shattered into pieces .
The first is it made me fall in love with Africa .
Let me make it a bit more concrete .
You become the president of the United States .
So you decide , perhaps let me pass a law .
You say , perhaps , &quot; Let me print some money .
I think the economy needs a stimulus . &quot;
The central bank governor will think you &apos;re crazy .
You might get impeached for that .
You decide you want to print money .
We &apos;ve had three generations of leaders , in my mind .
The legacy they left is that they brought independence to Africa .
They were followed by generation two .
Think warfare , corruption , human rights abuses .
So where to from here ?
Why is prosperity so important ?
And she &apos;s just turned 18 .
Another example is Erick Rajaonary .
Erick comes from the island of Madagascar .
Erick is known as the Batman .
No , I don &apos;t think so .
Laetitia is one of our young leaders .
But one thing has been troubling me .
But we couldn &apos;t satisfy it .
But they won &apos;t just learn academics .
We cannot transform Africa by ourselves .
You can be that great generation . &quot;
Thank you .
So when I meet refugees , I always ask them questions .
Who bombed your house ?
Who killed your son ?
Did the rest of your family make it out alive ?
How are you coping in your life in exile ?
And he would risk his life to get that diploma .
But one day , the family got terrible news .
Their throats were slit .
It was time to flee .
This is generosity and humanity that is remarkable .
Six and a half million people have fled for their lives .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred .
And she said yes , but she refused to smile .
Hany &apos;s home was also destroyed .
This will need to be rebuilt by architects , by engineers , by electricians .
You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state .
Well far from it .
And there are more and more victims .
They flee across borders like this one .
Well , I think that should be the minimum .
Thank you .
We can help them thrive .
And imagine living in this camp .
I visited this camp .
It was dusty and it was terribly hot .
and , &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
My schooling days are over . &quot;
And I also thought , what a waste .
She should be and she is the future of Somalia .
So I want to take you back to Hany .
Hany is at a tipping point .
University is a luxury .
Thank you .
Jorge Soto : The future of early cancer detection ?
It was stage 3 lung cancer .
Her lifestyle was almost free of risk .
So microRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression .
It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes .
Let me do a demonstration .
This entire platform is a working prototype .
You don &apos;t need to have any symptoms .
You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools .
Today , cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear .
It is too expensive for our families .
It is too expensive for humanity .
We cannot lose the war against cancer .
Thank you very much .
Jeff Iliff : One more reason to get a good night &apos;s sleep
Sleep .
You can actually see it in this video here .
It &apos;s a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body .
But that doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense , does it ?
It was ingenious , but it was also beautiful .
Let me tell you about what we found .
We call it the CSF .
You can see that in these videos .
Here , we &apos;re again imaging into the brain of living mice .
It &apos;s almost nothing .
Thank you .
Dilip Ratha : The hidden force in global economics : sending money home
My father was a government worker .
So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up .
I had dreams of going to the United States for higher studies .
My story is not unique .
There are millions of people who migrate each year .
There are 232 million international migrants in the world .
Those sums of money are called remittances .
In Tajikistan , remittances are 42 percent of GDP .
They actually act like an insurance .
Migrants send more money then .
Remittances are dollars wrapped with care .
The global average cost of sending money is eight percent .
For example , sending money from Benin to Nigeria .
It all goes in suitcases .
Whereever costs are high , money goes underground .
There are .
Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia .
I cannot go to a cheaper option .
This has to go .
You have seen what has happened there .
I was in Dubai a few years ago .
I visited a camp for workers .
The remittance arrives .
This has to stop .
The family doesn &apos;t get to see any of it .
It is not only men .
Remittances empower people .
And it can be done .
My wife is a Venezuelan .
My children are Americans .
I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time .
My parents are not there anymore .
My brothers and sisters have moved on .
There is no real urgency for me to send money home .
Thank you .
Pia Mancini : How to upgrade democracy for the Internet era
Let &apos;s have a look at some of the characteristics of this system .
And the many get to vote once every couple of years .
We want our seat at the table .
And rightly so .
And we should be immensely proud of this .
What institutions do we want to build for the 21st-century society ?
I don &apos;t have the answer , just in case .
I don &apos;t think anyone does .
So DemocracyOS is about persuading and being persuaded .
And yes , we failed .
We failed big time .
We were sent to play outside like little kids .
Amongst other things , we were called naive .
It was our way of hacking the political system .
But it got attention .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
And in my heart , it &apos;s most definitely worth trying .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s take a look .
I live there on the corner .
It started a couple of years ago .
So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing .
The first piece that I played through started like this .
Well this sounds very melancholic , doesn &apos;t it ?
And I turned the page and what came next was this .
Well , this sounds very energetic , doesn &apos;t it ?
Thank you .
Nancy Kanwisher : A neural portrait of the human mind
Do you need new glasses ?
Are you losing your mind ?
You run through a quick mental checklist .
Here we go .
It &apos;s not that easy . It &apos;s an artichoke .
Broccoli ! It &apos;s a head of broccoli .
Isn &apos;t it beautiful ? I love that .
Okay , here &apos;s another one . It &apos;s a brain , of course .
In fact , it &apos;s my brain .
We &apos;re going through slices through my head like that .
So here &apos;s how this works .
Brains are like muscles .
So I was the first subject .
Well , the easiest way is to just do the experiment again .
So the next question was , what does this thing really do ?
Is it really specialized just for face recognition ?
Well , maybe not , right ?
No , we haven &apos;t .
So let &apos;s watch what happens .
All right ?
Patient : Okay .
Neurologist : One , two , three .
I &apos;m going to do it one more time .
Look at my face .
One , two , three .
Patient : You just turned into somebody else .
Your face metamorphosed .
That was a trip .
So let &apos;s get started . Here &apos;s my right hemisphere .
So that &apos;s not good . Stuff could be hidden in there .
Okay , now let &apos;s look at these same regions .
Yes , we do .
So much for &quot; Oprah . &quot;
I mean , it could have been otherwise .
It &apos;s early days in this enterprise .
The most fundamental questions remain unanswered .
So for example , what does each of these regions do exactly ?
I met her two years ago .
I don &apos;t understand why I &apos;m being passed over . &quot;
Here &apos;s what I mean by that .
So which element of leadership does that relate to ?
Personal greatness .
Which element of leadership does that equate to ?
Engaging the greatness in others .
And then they pretty much stopped .
And to a man , they said , &quot; That &apos;s a given . &quot;
So this is obvious , right ?
But how can it be ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that this advice is unimportant .
Well , there are primarily two ways .
And he was sincere about that .
Thank you .
The male-dominated field made my presence unwelcome by all possible means .
The &quot; No &quot; sign was pretty clear .
The perception of women &apos;s life in Gaza is passive .
To men , women &apos;s stories were seen as inconsequential .
I became a witness with a choice : to run away or stand still .
Thank you .
Kenneth Cukier : Big data is better data
America &apos;s favorite pie is ?
Audience : Apple . Kenneth Cukier : Apple . Of course it is .
How do we know it ?
Because of data .
You look at supermarket sales .
The majority of the sales are apple .
Why ? What happened ?
Okay , think about it .
You can get your first choice .
You have more data .
It allows us to see better .
It allows us to see different .
This is how society stored and transmitted information .
Now , society hasn &apos;t advanced all that much .
Sharing it is easier . Processing it is easier .
There is , if you will , a liquidity to information .
More data . More .
Think , for example , the question of location .
Take , for example , Martin Luther .
In this respect , location has been datafied .
So what could we do with this ?
What could we do then ?
So what is the value of big data ?
Well , think about it .
You have more information .
He played . He won .
He played . He won .
Arthur Samuel knew something else .
Arthur Samuel knew strategy .
He plays the computer . He wins .
He plays the computer . He wins .
He plays the computer . He wins .
It plays itself . It collects more data .
How do you think we have self-driving cars ?
No . Memory is cheaper . No .
It &apos;s because we changed the nature of the problem .
You figure it out .
The problem : The medical literature only knew nine of them .
Now , there are dark sides to big data as well .
Privacy was the central challenge in a small data era .
The person went to university .
The person buys property .
He or she votes .
The Industrial Revolution wasn &apos;t very good if you were a horse .
It &apos;s not just a problem for the National Security Agency .
We are at a remarkable moment in time .
Let me illustrate with an example .
The roads are jammed by cars and trucks .
The air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal and diesel .
How did this come about ?
It has become the world &apos;s second largest economy .
Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty .
That &apos;s really important .
China &apos;s planning to scale back coal .
It &apos;s looking to build its cities in different ways .
That &apos;s a remarkable change .
Fifty percent now in urban areas .
That &apos;s going to go to 70 percent in 2050 .
This is profound structural change .
And we couldn &apos;t just turn it off .
You can &apos;t make a peace treaty with the planet .
You can &apos;t negotiate with the laws of physics .
You &apos;re in there . You &apos;re stuck .
Now , the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway .
The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do .
And let me start with cities .
Now , some things in cities do take time .
Some things in cities can happen much more quickly .
Take my hometown , London .
And it happened all the time .
will remember it used to be called The Smoke .
That &apos;s the way London was .
I remember the smogs well .
This was the 1950s .
Again , breathing was a hazardous activity .
But it was changed . It was changed by a decision .
Let me turn to energy .
Now , energy over the last 25 years has increased by about 50 percent .
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels .
We can see how to do that .
Take the example of California .
That &apos;s a striking achievement .
It shows what can be done .
They &apos;ve set themselves a target of five years .
Four hundred million , more than the population of the United States .
Look at land , land and particularly forests .
But we &apos;re losing our forests .
And it &apos;s not just stopping deforestation .
I first went to Ethiopia in 1967 .
You &apos;re seeing that commitment there .
You &apos;re seeing what can be done .
Ethiopia is investing in clean energy .
It &apos;s working in the rehabilitation of land .
We do understand how to manage those well .
And technology is changing very rapidly .
You can see better insulation .
And there &apos;s much more coming .
We need political pressure to build .
We need leaders to step up .
We know that we can do this .
Now , two weeks ago , I became a grandfather for the fourth time .
Two weeks old .
Avi Reichental : What &apos;s next in 3D printing
My grandfather was a cobbler .
I never got to meet him .
He perished in the Holocaust .
It &apos;s a little older than TED .
So think about useful things .
You all know your shoe size .
Anybody ?
It wasn &apos;t made to measure .
And you know what ? She &apos;s not standing still .
She now wants to walk in high heels .
It doesn &apos;t stop there .
Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today .
Millions of people are served today from these devices .
Good for G.E. , right ?
And their customers and the environment .
A real moonshot , powered by 3D printing .
How about food ?
With 3D printing , complexity is free .
That will take new tools .
I think it &apos;s the wrong question to ask .
Now , these are not my grandfather &apos;s shoes .
He passed away three years ago .
Thank you .
Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
So how could I untangle this knotted bunch of sentences ?
And I said , I &apos;ve got PowerPoint . Let &apos;s do a Venn diagram .
&#91; &quot; Truth . Lies . &quot; &#93; So there it is , right there , boom .
That liminal space , that &apos;s art .
I used to be a summer camp counselor .
You &apos;re the guy who spies for the Queen of England . &quot;
And she was like , &quot; Why ? &quot;
And so Riley was like , &quot; That will never happen .
That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot;
I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
Adults can too , and we get there when we read .
This is a place called 826 Valencia .
It &apos;s a secret door that you can walk through .
So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart .
That &apos;s our motto : &quot; Whenever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot;
And it &apos;s on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles .
Our friendly staff is ready to help you .
Some great people have come up through our ranks .
This is our kind of pharmacy section .
It was going to be the highlight of our store .
Mammoth Chunks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
Dead languages .
Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
The joke isn &apos;t a joke .
I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions .
It &apos;s almost as old as storytelling itself .
For me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
It &apos;s called &quot; Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem . &quot;
A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
And kids do write in .
Eliot Gannon . &quot;
And they get a picture of their whale too .
This is the first message I ever got from Nico .
Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
I am your owner , Randolph . Hello .
Mac Barnett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
And here &apos;s another one of Nico &apos;s messages .
Nico : Hello , Randolph , this is Nico .
MB : So he did , he called back that day again .
This is the Christmas message from Nico .
So have a nice Christmas , and bye-bye , Randolph . Goodbye .
But Nico &apos;s the best reader I could hope for .
Thank you very much .
Uldus Bakhtiozina : Wry photos that turn stereotypes upside down
Good afternoon .
My name is Uldus .
I am a photo-based artist from Russia .
Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
Be brave . Be ironic — it helps .
Be funny and create some magic .
Please answer A , B or C.
Oh , very , very good .
And we go to the next question .
A , B or C ? Please answer .
And we go to the next question .
Extreme poverty — not having enough food for the day .
A , B or C ?
Now , answers .
And then , how did that change ?
Gapminder asked the public in Sweden .
This is how they answered .
Now how did you do ?
That &apos;s you .
You were beaten by the chimps .
But it was close .
You must have higher ambitions in the world .
Let &apos;s look at the next answer here : women in school .
How long did women go to school ?
Let &apos;s see , let &apos;s see . Here we come .
Yes , yes , yes , women have almost caught up .
This is the U.S. public .
And this is you . Here you come .
Ooh .
Now , we miss the majority .
What about poverty ?
And you ?
Ah , you almost made it to the chimps .
That little , just a few of you !
There must be preconceived ideas , you know .
The world was two groups .
The percent in poverty has decreased .
Well , it &apos;s me . It &apos;s me .
It &apos;s very difficult , this . It &apos;s very difficult .
So Ola told me , &quot; Take these devices .
You are invited to media conferences .
And then , lately , from the European Union media .
What shall we do about this , Ola ?
Do we have any ideas ?
That &apos;s basically what I will do .
It was not representative . Okay ?
We have a personal bias .
So that &apos;s what we are focusing on .
What happens next is news , okay ?
Unusual events are more interesting , no ?
It was good in evolution .
So how do we solve such problems ?
Okay , I gather those facts .
Imagine a long list with , say , 250 facts .
Okay , this little shortlist , what are we going to do with it ?
Of course you shouldn &apos;t .
So now we come to the practical tricks .
How are you going to succeed ?
That will never happen , actually .
Not even Hans thinks that &apos;s going to happen .
People don &apos;t have that time .
People like shortcuts , and here are the shortcuts .
We need to turn our intuition into strength again .
We need to be able to generalize .
Let &apos;s start with the first misconception .
This is very widespread .
Everything is getting worse .
You heard it . You thought it yourself .
The other way to think is , most things improve .
Okay ? Don &apos;t go for the worse .
That was the first one .
It &apos;s a terrible inequality .
That &apos;s going to help you get the answer right .
No , no , no . That &apos;s wrong .
Let &apos;s look at the last one .
I actually , I &apos;m very afraid of sharks .
That &apos;s a rule of thumb .
They cannot generalize these kinds of rules .
That &apos;s a systematic approach .
Now the question , is this important ?
We &apos;re going back to these two humps in 1975 .
That &apos;s when I was born , and I selected the West .
But this has changed , okay ?
So first , let &apos;s look at the change up till today , 2014 .
Today it &apos;s 50 / 50 .
The Western domination is over , as of today .
That &apos;s nice . So what &apos;s going to happen next ?
Let &apos;s move into the future .
In 2020 , it &apos;s 57 percent in the rest .
In 2025 , 63 percent .
Thank you very much .
Hans and Ola Rosling !
I just didn &apos;t really know how .
It &apos;s really pretty remarkable .
You can see the six solar collectors at the center there .
The Lowline would really be a four-season space and a respite for the city .
Thanks .
Colin Grant : How our stories cross over
This is my father , Clinton George &quot; Bageye &quot; Grant .
Maybe it &apos;s a migrant lesson .
&quot; You are being watched .
Actually , you are .
You are being watched . &quot;
That was his mantra to us , his children .
Time and time again he would say this to us .
Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear .
Anxious is always anxious .
Clock has one arm longer than the other .
You did not just represent yourself .
So that was what needed to be challenged .
They were built to transmit but not receive .
We were to keep quiet .
But they do care , actually .
They cross over .
Somehow they find their way to you .
So listen to how I sound .
The children became the parents to the parent .
The reality was very much different .
And also , that was true of the reality of trying to educate me .
Having started the process , my father did not continue .
And I wonder what Bageye would make of that .
I was very disconcerted by that .
But I never felt that connection .
This will close the generation gap , perhaps .
This could be an instrument of repair .
Poor , deluded fool .
I was no son of his .
I lost my hatred of my father .
But there &apos;s another way of looking at this photograph .
I was almost a foot taller than my father .
There was dignity in defeat .
Thank you .
Shubhendu Sharma : How to grow a tiny forest anywhere
I &apos;m an industrial engineer .
I wanted to make more of these forests .
But that &apos;s not enough .
This methodology , I believe , has a potential .
Thank you very much . Thanks .
Isabel Allende : How to live passionately — no matter your age
Hi , kids .
I &apos;m 71 .
My husband is 76 .
So let &apos;s talk about aging .
Me , I intend to live passionately .
When do we start aging ?
I am still 17 .
Sophia Loren . Look at her .
But attitude , aging is also attitude and health .
She has also founded orphanages and nutritional clinics .
She is always happy and eternally young .
What have I lost in the last decades ?
What have I gained ?
Freedom : I don &apos;t have to prove anything anymore .
My body may be falling apart , but my brain is not , yet .
I love my brain .
I feel lighter .
It &apos;s great to let go .
I should have started sooner .
I don &apos;t see it as weakness anymore .
And I &apos;ve gained spirituality .
Meditation helps .
Ommm . Ommm . Ommm .
Isabel Allende : Ommm . Ommm . There it is .
And it &apos;s good to start early .
Inside , I feel good , I feel charming , seductive , sexy .
I want to be the center of attention .
I hate to be invisible .
This is Grace Dammann .
She doesn &apos;t see herself as disabled .
In her mind , she &apos;s still surfing in the ocean .
So how can I stay passionate ?
Attitude , attitude .
Yes to life .
And I train by trying to stay in love .
Jubilation . Celebration .
We have paid our dues .
We have contributed to society .
Now it &apos;s our time , and it &apos;s a great time .
I have chosen to stay passionate , engaged with an open heart .
I am working on it every day .
Want to join me ?
Thank you .
So Isabel — I Thank you .
I Oh , of course . About what ?
Moderator : About your erotic fantasies . I With Antonio Banderas .
Once ? Twice ? Seventeen times ?
And she said , &quot; Awesome . &quot;
And I thought , &quot; Really ?
How about that parking space ? Was that awesome ?
Or that game the other day ? Was that awesome ?
The answer is no , no and no .
Yes , so I think I &apos;ll invent the wheel .
The wheel , ladies and gentlemen .
Is the wheel awesome ? Say it with me .
Yes , the wheel is awesome !
Were the Great Pyramids awesome ?
Yes , the pyramids were awesome .
The Grand Canyon . Come on .
It &apos;s almost 80 million years old .
Is the Grand Canyon awesome ?
Yes , the Grand Canyon is .
I mean , come on . Is photography awesome ?
Yes , photography is awesome .
Was D-Day awesome ? Yes , it was awesome .
Did you eat food today ? Did you eat ?
It &apos;s just like that .
Bees are awesome . Are you kidding me ?
Landing on the moon ! Come on !
Apollo 11 . Are you kidding me ?
That &apos;s like from here to the moon .
You &apos;re damn right , it was .
Tickets were only 24 dollars back then .
Was Woodstock awesome ? Yes , it was awesome .
Sharks ! They &apos;re at the top of the food chain .
Does awesome inspire fear ?
Oh , hell yeah , sharks are awesome !
I will save you the time .
That &apos;s a thing . Google it .
I &apos;m talking about nasty personal attacks .
Which , incidentally , is only a third correct .
I don &apos;t mean giving up the Internet .
Increasingly , we &apos;re all the media .
That is a public act of making media .
Wrong .
We are the new editors .
That &apos;s how the media works now .
It does not have to be that way .
It does not .
We can change the incentive .
For starters , there are two things we can all do .
Be a hero . This is your chance .
Speak up . Speak out . Be a good person .
Drown out the negative with the positive .
I know you do it . You too , apparently .
Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it .
It makes it worse , the fire spreads .
Our whole culture gets burned .
So click responsibly . Thank you .
That ended the discussion .
Go find us some insurance . &quot;
It &apos;s microinsurance .
So instead , we rely on technology and data .
The data alone isn &apos;t enough .
I was disappointed and confounded .
Why would I buy insurance now ? &quot;
That &apos;s an attractive proposition .
It &apos;s a very different value proposition .
How do you expect me to repay my loan ? &quot;
They couldn &apos;t take on this kind of risk .
So they took out loans and planted .
We &apos;ve got you .
Could you give us the money now ?
One of the first — — Hold on , I &apos;m not there !
Thank you .
Martin Rees : Can we prevent the end of the world ?
Americans like instant gratification and the reverse .
The worst have thankfully not yet happened .
Indeed , they probably won &apos;t .
We get ever more vulnerable .
Well , can we guard against such risks by regulation ?
It &apos;s like the drug laws — we try to regulate , but can &apos;t .
Well luckily , reassurance could be offered .
Scenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity .
Scenario B wipes out 100 percent .
How much worse is B than A ?
Some would say 10 percent worse .
The body count is 10 percent higher .
And so let &apos;s not jeopardize that future .
Thank you very much .
Ziyah Gafic ́ : Everyday objects , tragic histories
These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
As much as genocide is about killing .
I like to move beyond raising awareness .
Thank you very much .
Jarrett J. Krosoczka : Why lunch ladies are heroes
I had never thought about any of that before .
But it meant the most to Jeannie .
I didn &apos;t think that anyone noticed us down here . &quot;
A thank you can change a life .
Thank you .
The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
Actually , the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy .
Like , you can see here in the Rcif Plaza .
This is how it looked like about six years ago .
This is how it looks like today .
And finally , this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like when the project is completed .
This is the river , covered , used as a trash yard .
Thank you very much .
Clint Smith : The danger of silence
As a teacher , I &apos;ve internalized this message .
But one year , I gave up speaking .
Silence is the residue of fear .
It is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue .
It is the air retreating from your chest Silence is Rwandan genocide . Silence is Katrina .
It is the sound after the noose is already tied .
It is charring . It is chains . It is privilege . It is pain .
Thank you .
Dan Pacholke : How prisons can help inmates live meaningful lives
That &apos;s our job : contain them , control them .
And yet , we are called the Department of Corrections .
I followed my dad into this field .
He was strong , steady , disciplined .
In many ways , it was worse .
I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high .
There were eight men to a cell .
there were 550 men in that living unit .
Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells .
I walked away as fast as I could .
Eventually I went back and I started as an officer there .
Contain and control — that was our job .
Guess what ?
It got quieter .
Disturbances died down in the general population .
But isolation isn &apos;t good .
Deprive people of social contact and they deteriorate .
We met violence with force and chaos with chaos .
We were pretty good at putting out fires .
Have you ever thought about how to prevent them ? &quot;
They were patient with me .
Instead of four weeks of training , we gave them 10 .
They both got better at the work .
It was the non-force use of force .
And then we did something even more radical .
We trained the inmates on those same skills .
There were no toilets .
No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet .
We all thought it was dangerous and crazy .
Even eight men to a cell had a toilet .
That small detail changed the way we worked .
It was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated .
Interacting changes the way you behave , both for the officer and the inmate .
We changed the environment and we changed the behavior .
When we changed the environment , the behavior changed .
And these were not huge system changes .
One of them was a rainforest ecologist .
The project just made my job more interesting and exciting .
I was excited . Staff were excited .
Officers were excited . Inmates were excited .
They were inspired .
Everybody wanted to be part of this .
Let me be clear on what &apos;s going on here , though .
Inmates are highly adaptive . They have to be .
And they &apos;re here for a reason .
Remember , IMUs are for punishment .
In fact , they needed intensive programming .
What we found was a new kind of chair .
Now , I can &apos;t tell you that any of this stuff will work .
What I can tell you , though , it is working .
These are not opposing qualities .
Our strategy is not massive system change .
Prisons need to be secure , yes , safe , yes .
We can do that .
We &apos;re learning how to do that .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m hopeful .
We don &apos;t have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison .
Thank you .
Talithia Williams : Own your body &apos;s data
Now , as a statistician , what &apos;s my response ?
Show me the data !
Maybe it was shifting around . &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t want to take any chances . &quot;
I said okay .
Would your decision be to induce ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we just do it again ?
We can collect more data .
I can try to be really still for 20 minutes .
That makes three of us .
Show me the data !
Let &apos;s talk chances . Let &apos;s talk chances .
So I say , &quot; Okay , great .
Where are we here with this miscarriage thing ?
Undaunted , I try a different angle .
And so we ended up leaving the hospital that day without being induced .
Well , we had data that told a different story .
We had been collecting data for six years .
In fact , we could probably pretty accurately estimate conception .
Now , what does that data look like ?
You &apos;ll see that the temperature is not random .
So what &apos;s happening here ?
What is that data telling you ?
So why this temperature jump ?
Well , think about when a bird sits on her eggs .
Why is she sitting on them ?
We were really very excited about this chart .
What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem ?
Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature for your body .
If it gets too hot , your thyroid cools you down .
So , what if you don &apos;t want to take your temperature every day ?
You &apos;re having a heart attack .
We ride our bikes , we go to the gym occasionally .
We move around .
I &apos;m thinking , I was sleeping , honestly .
But okay , what was Donald doing just before ?
He gives us a prescription .
This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old .
What story is this data telling you ?
You become the authority .
It &apos;s not hard to do .
Yes , get it up .
I challenge you to take ownership of your data .
Audience : Show me the data !
TW : One more time !
Audience : Show me the data !
TW : Show me the data .
Thank you .
Megan Washington : Why I live in mortal dread of public speaking
I have a problem .
It &apos;s not the worst thing in the world .
I &apos;m fine . I &apos;m not on fire .
And the thing is that I have a stutter .
I &apos;ve never really talked about it before so explicitly .
I &apos;m pretty sure that I &apos;m grown now .
So , I might as well come clean about it .
There are some interesting angles to having a stutter .
People think I &apos;m drunk all the time .
But with people &apos;s names , you can &apos;t change them .
And I do use that . I do .
I get through it that way for my job .
It &apos;s more than feeling known , or understood .
It &apos;s more than making you feel the things that I feel .
And that &apos;s why I &apos;m here today .
Thank you .
Singing for me is sweet relief .
It is the only time when I feel fluent .
This is a song that I wrote last year .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Take a look at this drawing .
Can you tell what it is ?
So we start outside of the cell .
Now we &apos;re looking inside .
Why ?
The payoffs can be huge , though .
I believe that animation can change biology .
Thank you .
Ze Frank : Are you human ?
Please raise your hand if something applies to you .
Are we agreed ? Yes ?
Then let &apos;s begin .
It &apos;s okay , it &apos;s safe here .
Okay .
Yes .
Yes .
Good .
Mmm .
Yes , it &apos;s safe here .
Mmm .
Congratulations .
You have now completed the test .
You are all human .
I was born in Taiwan .
I also like to modify household appliances .
This is an automatic night light .
Some of you might have them at home .
This sculpture has four eyes .
Each eye is controlling a different device .
This eye is inflating a plastic tube .
And these two eyes are activating glowing water .
I love science and biology .
Thank you .
Puzzles and magic .
Human beings are wired to solve , to make order out of chaos .
It &apos;s certainly true for me .
I &apos;ve been solving my whole life .
I test your ability to solve .
And then the pattern was changed : triangle , square .
It &apos;s remarkable .
Like .
Now , solving exists across all cultures .
Chaos . Order .
Order .
And order .
Okay .
So as you can see , we are always solving .
We are always trying to decode our world .
It &apos;s an eternal quest .
But anyway , &quot; Don Quixote &quot; is an important book .
You guys have read &quot; Don Quixote , &quot; yes ?
I &apos;m seeing some heads nod .
Come on guys , really ?
Who &apos;s read &quot; Don Quixote ? &quot; Let &apos;s do this . Raise your hands if you &apos;ve read &quot; Don Quixote . &quot;
There we go . Smart audience .
Who &apos;s read &quot; Don Quixote ? &quot; Get them up .
Let &apos;s see .
Everybody &apos;s looking away all of a sudden .
Gwen , after you .
Are you so excited ?
Okay , stand right here , Gwen , right here .
And over here we have a drawing of some farm animals .
Gwen : Cobalt . David Kwong : Cobalt , yes . Cobalt .
It &apos;s going to be a lot of fun .
But I &apos;m going to go over here .
I don &apos;t want to see what you &apos;re doing .
Now Gwen , are you ready ?
All right . Great .
Big scribbles .
And color in the owl for me .
Color in the owl .
Good , good , good , good , good .
Big , big , big strokes . Good , good .
Okay , good .
This is still going to work , though .
I think this is still going to work , mostly .
So Gwen , I &apos;m going to hand you this envelope .
An emerald rooster . Okay .
Yes , I think it does .
So ladies and gentlemen , how is this possible ?
Well this is the puzzle I present to you .
Let &apos;s take a closer look .
The plot thickens .
And then we played a game of tangrams with an emerald rooster .
That one &apos;s my favorite .
And then we had an experiment with a silver ox .
Thank you , Katy , for taking that photo for me .
Oh , and there &apos;s one more , there &apos;s one more .
There &apos;s more .
The date is March 18th , 2014 .
Really dig . We hid them under there .
You can see my name above the grid .
I &apos;m going to give this to you , Gwen , to take a look .
And I will also put it up on the screen .
That &apos;s pretty cool , right ?
It &apos;s The New York Times .
But wait , wait , wait , wait . Wait .
That &apos;s chaos and order .
We &apos;ve all made order out of chaos .
Thank you .
George Takei : Why I love a country that once betrayed me
I &apos;m a veteran of the starship Enterprise .
My mother was born in Sacramento , California .
My father was a San Franciscan .
America suddenly was swept up by hysteria .
That all disappeared .
They carried bayonets on their rifles .
They stomped up the front porch and banged on the door .
I will never be able to forget that scene .
It is burned into my memory .
I still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me .
Children are amazingly adaptable .
We were penniless .
We had lost everything .
All men are created equal .
And they went to fight for this country .
They fought with amazing , incredible courage and valor .
There is one battle that illustrates that .
It was a battle for the Gothic Line .
They climbed all night long on that sheer cliff .
They all fell silently .
They are my heroes .
Thank you very much .
Paul Bloom : Can prejudice ever be a good thing ?
And the thing is , these judgments tend to be accurate .
We &apos;re very good at this sort of thing .
Now we might be wrong .
But for the most part , we &apos;re good at this .
Or take bias .
But other times we &apos;re proud of it .
We openly acknowledge it .
AC : Governor Perry , what about that ?
Now some of you may reject this .
Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919 .
He got involved in different pursuits .
He helped out the war orphans .
And Tajfel rejected this .
It was entirely bogus .
He just arbitrarily divided them up .
This bias seems to show up very early .
So one of the puppets might like green beans .
The other puppet might like graham crackers .
We see this sort of in-group , out-group psychology all the time .
Stereotypes can also go awry .
And the case that &apos;s been most studied is the case of race .
But they were responding , of course , to the color of his skin .
They were the same baseball cards .
And there are different avenues .
If I look at the one , I will . &quot;
Psychologists have explored this .
This is Harriet Beecher Stowe .
And he was talking about &quot; Uncle Tom &apos;s Cabin . &quot;
And Smith says , how would you respond ?
Smith says , that would matter a lot .
Our reason could cause us to override our passions .
This is what a constitution is .
We have bound ourselves .
And we bind ourselves in other ways as well .
But other times we say , &quot; This is wrong . &quot;
Thank you .
Sara Lewis : The loves and lies of fireflies
Maybe something like this .
Are they talking to one another ?
In person , fireflies are charming .
They &apos;re charismatic .
They &apos;ve been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries .
Other creatures can enjoy them too .
They flew during the daytime and they didn &apos;t light up .
In other fireflies , it &apos;s only the females who light up .
How do they do that ?
Incredible .
But how could these bright lights have benefited some proto-firefly ?
Fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow .
And firefly light first originated in these juveniles .
to any would-be predators .
They &apos;re flying and flashing their hearts out .
I still find it very romantic .
But meanwhile , where are all the females ?
Well , they &apos;re lounging down below surveying their options .
It &apos;s her &quot; come hither &quot; sign .
So he flies closer and he flashes again .
These creatures speak their love in the language of light .
So what exactly do these females consider sexy ?
We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls to find out .
We can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair .
So it &apos;s not all sweetness and light .
Firefly romance is risky .
His own female responds , &quot; Maybe . &quot;
So then he flashes again .
She &apos;s not looking for love : she &apos;s looking for toxins .
The main culprit : habitat loss .
Do we really need fireflies ?
Thank you .
Julian Treasure : How to speak so that people want to listen
The human voice : It &apos;s the instrument we all play .
It &apos;s the most powerful sound in the world , probably .
And why is that ?
First , gossip , speaking ill of somebody who &apos;s not present .
Second , judging .
Third , negativity .
You can fall into this .
It &apos;s hard to listen when somebody &apos;s that negative .
And another form of negativity , complaining .
Well , this is the national art of the U.K.
It &apos;s not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world .
Excuses . We &apos;ve all met this guy .
Maybe we &apos;ve all been this guy .
Some people have a blamethrower .
Penultimate , the sixth of the seven , embroidery , exaggeration .
It demeans our language , actually , sometimes .
And finally , dogmatism , the confusion of facts with opinions .
You know , somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true .
It &apos;s difficult to listen to that .
So here they are , seven deadly sins of speaking .
These are things I think we need to avoid .
Yes , there is .
Fortunately , these things spell a word .
The word is &quot; hail , &quot; and it has a great definition as well .
So what do they stand for ?
See if you can guess .
The H , honesty , of course , being true in what you say , being straight and clear .
The A is authenticity , just being yourself .
And the L is love .
Perhaps that &apos;s not necessary .
So hail .
You have an amazing toolbox .
Register , for example .
You can locate your voice , however .
You hear the difference ?
That &apos;s register .
Then we have timbre .
It &apos;s the way your voice feels .
Go and get a voice coach .
Then prosody . I love prosody .
It &apos;s root one for meaning in conversation .
We don &apos;t have to fill it with ums and ahs .
It can be very powerful .
Where did you leave my keys ?
Where did you leave my keys ?
And finally , volume .
I can get really excited by using volume .
Sorry about that if I startled anybody .
Some people broadcast the whole time .
Try not to do that .
It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people .
It might be proposing marriage , asking for a raise , a wedding speech .
Warm up your voice .
Actually , let me show you how to do that .
Would you all like to stand up for a moment ?
Anytime you &apos;re going to talk to anybody important , do these .
One more time .
Ahhhh , very good .
And now , brrrrrrrrrr , just like when you were a kid .
Brrrr . Now your lips should be coming alive .
Beautiful . You &apos;re getting really good at this .
And then , roll an R. Rrrrrrr .
That &apos;s like champagne for the tongue .
The &quot; we &quot; is high , the &quot; aw &quot; is low .
So you go , weeeaawww , weeeaawww .
Fantastic . Give yourselves a round of applause .
Now let me just put this in context to close .
This is a serious point here .
This is where we are now , right ?
Thank you .
Thank you .
Ge Wang : The DIY orchestra of the future
To which I usually respond , I do computer music .
Which is true .
In fact , I would invite all of you to join me in just geeking out .
I &apos;ll bet you &apos;ll be able to come along on this .
So I &apos;ve connected myself into the speaker .
Let &apos;s do this every 200 milliseconds .
All right .
the canonical computer music .
So is this computer music ?
Yeah , I guess by definition , it &apos;s kind of computer music .
So these speakers are meant to emulate that .
This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt .
And what might a laptop orchestra sound like ?
And what I &apos;m going to do is actually come over to this thing .
This thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands .
We can prototype instruments out of this . &quot;
So let me see if this will work .
And put it back .
This is a slightly metallic sound .
It &apos;s like a hovering car .
Thank you .
And when you put that together , you get something that sounds like this .
And I &apos;m going to just demo this for you real quick .
Huh , that &apos;s a nice chord to end this excerpt on .
Thank you .
I &apos;m not sure why that would be .
Maybe it &apos;s because it &apos;s too easy just to hit play .
And this is what it sounds like when there &apos;s 1,000 people . This is 1,000 voices .
Was that computer music ?
It is about people .
Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe .
But how do we know if they are right ?
Why should be believe the science ?
So why should we believe the science ?
Maybe a few hours on Sunday .
Why do they believe each other &apos;s claims ?
And should we believe those claims ?
Because if it is a law , it can &apos;t be broken .
The main problem is that it &apos;s wrong .
So the first reason is a logical reason .
It &apos;s the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent .
Well , why ?
So that &apos;s one problem with the textbook model .
So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes .
So what happened ?
The first was an assumption about the size of the Earth &apos;s orbit .
And that turned out not to be true .
So , there &apos;s a third problem as well .
So he started collecting data .
And how do we do that ?
Maybe it &apos;s going to rain .
But a computer simulation is a kind of a model .
So what , though , is driving that change ?
So here is the real life in black .
Scientists are creative .
And who judges ?
That is to say , the burden of proof is on the person with a novel claim .
And in this sense , science is intrinsically conservative .
Scientists can say no , it &apos;s false .
It &apos;s the authority of the collective community .
Okay , so that brings me to my final point .
Most of us get up in the morning .
Most of us trust our cars .
The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down .
So why is that ? Why do cars work so well ?
Thank you very much .
Lorrie Faith Cranor : What &apos;s wrong with your pa $ $ w0rd ?
So passwords are something that I hear a lot about .
It &apos;s tough .
And I said , &quot; Well , you know what ?
They didn &apos;t ask me . &quot;
No , we just asked them about their password .
How long is it ? Does it have a digit ?
Does it have a symbol ?
A smart attacker , on the other hand , does something much more clever .
Here are some examples .
So this was pretty fun .
&quot; Oh , have you seen it ? That xkcd .
Correct horse battery staple . &quot;
So we tried a few different conditions .
That comes up with something that &apos;s sort of sentence-like .
And then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password .
That one kind of rolls off your tongue .
So it &apos;s not really a clear win for pass phrases .
Sorry , all of you xkcd fans .
They audited our code .
They ran the code .
So that was good news .
It &apos;s called &quot; Security Blanket . &quot;
So here are some examples of the difficulty .
So &quot; justin . &quot;
Maybe they &apos;re a Justin Bieber fan .
Or &quot; princess . &quot;
Is that a nickname ?
Are they Disney princess fans ?
&quot; Iloveyou &quot; appears many times in many different languages .
There &apos;s a lot of love in these passwords .
And that guy is really cute .
Thank you .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll hear every mistake I make . &quot;
Those are the questions I want to talk about today .
I do not write dictionaries .
With that , let &apos;s turn to dictionaries .
Okay , so that looks like most of you .
Okay , many fewer .
I &apos;m actually fascinated by this .
Anyone who comes can vote .
The most important rule is that you can vote with only one hand .
Will all of these words stick ? Absolutely not .
We &apos;re noticing words that are coming into prominence .
It &apos;s really a question of attitude .
Think about the word &quot; peruse &quot; and how you use that word .
American Heritage has that as the first definition .
And what should I do with their pronouncements ? &quot;
But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries ?
There are about 200 people on the Usage Panel .
They include academicians , journalists , creative writers .
There &apos;s a Supreme Court justice on it and a few linguists .
As of 2005 , the list includes me .
We are not a language academy .
Now here &apos;s what I do to fill out the ballot .
I listen to what other people are saying and writing .
Does the language have to change that way ? &quot;
Well , you know what ?
Language just doesn &apos;t work that way .
So how does a word get into a dictionary ?
Thank you .
Now I did not know what to make of this .
Here I am alone in my office , but I &apos;m not alone at all .
It &apos;s in all seven continents , including Antarctica .
Here &apos;s my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow .
We have just 17 links between us .
And there &apos;s my cousin Barack Obama .
But does it really matter ?
What &apos;s the importance ?
First , it &apos;s got scientific value .
Number two , it brings history alive .
Also , it &apos;s not all good news .
Number three , interconnectedness .
We all have a bit of their DNA in us .
Now , it &apos;s not just ancestors we share , descendants .
Number four , a kinder world .
Now , I know that there are family feuds .
We &apos;re not just part of the same species .
We &apos;re part of the same family .
We share 99.9 percent of our DNA .
Now the final one is number five , a democratizing effect .
I thought , what can I do with this information ?
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
And you &apos;re all invited .
I want you there .
There &apos;s going to be exhibits and food , music .
He was a former member of the Obama administration .
Only together can we solve these big problems .
Goodbye .
Every research direction that I tried led to a dead end .
It seemed like my basic assumptions just stopped working .
I stopped shaving .
I couldn &apos;t get out of bed in the morning .
And so obviously , I couldn &apos;t be a scientist .
I got stuck and I made it through .
At the same time , I was also studying to be an improvisation theater actor .
You &apos;re going to fail miserably .
You &apos;re going to get stuck .
And we would practice staying creative inside that stuck place .
And I call this place the cloud .
It &apos;s dead , and everybody feels frustrated .
That &apos;s called blocking .
Saying &quot; Yes , and &quot; sounds like this .
It &apos;s pulling us to the moon ! &quot;
So saying &quot; Yes , and &quot; bypasses our inner critic .
We talk about the results .
So there was no way to talk about it in conferences .
That was unthinkable .
I thought , that &apos;s the way it is .
It &apos;s not by chance . It &apos;s a matter of values . &quot;
You see , science seeks knowledge that &apos;s objective and rational .
That &apos;s the beautiful thing about science .
I was in the cloud .
Thank you for your backup singing .
Finally , we can talk about this in a scientific conference .
Thank you .
The rest were outside at a new memorial .
But apparently , even exposing stuff like that is a threat .
They even included this nice little write-up of my book .
They described it as &quot; compelling and well-written . &quot;
Blurb on the next book , right ?
Our best weapon is sunlight .
It &apos;s time we strike a new note .
Thank you .
Keren Elazari : Hackers : the Internet &apos;s immune system
And I feel the same way .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m here today .
They scare us .
She portrayed Acid Burn in the &apos; 95 film &quot; Hackers . &quot;
Open Sesame .
This is the rush of power that hackers feel .
What would you do then ?
But they didn &apos;t steal anything .
Here &apos;s what you should do to fix it .
We hope we helped .
This is what Khalil did .
But I think there &apos;s a greater story here still .
Since then , they &apos;ve gone after many targets .
They &apos;ve uncovered corruption , abuse .
They can bring people together .
They are now shaping the world &apos;s stage .
Two years ago , I saw General Keith Alexander .
I think he saw untapped potential .
In fact , he was there to give a hiring pitch .
To me , that represents hope .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Hack the planet !
Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure . Here &apos;s a new behavior we &apos;ve discovered .
This is the foot of a cockroach .
They can run up mesh without their feet .
Here &apos;s one moving with two middle legs gone .
Robust systems are also damage resistant .
Here &apos;s an animal climbing up a wall .
Here &apos;s what they do .
extraordinary exoskeletons .
Here &apos;s a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach .
Now we want to know why they can go anywhere .
On and on and on .
Is it teenage years ? Is it middle age ?
Let me give you some data to back up that claim .
Here &apos;s three values .
So how does it do so ?
Well , we asked thousands of people .
Here &apos;s what we found .
We call this the &quot; end of history &quot; illusion .
Now it &apos;s not just values . It &apos;s all sorts of other things .
For example , personality .
People can name these things .
Does any of this matter ?
Is this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn &apos;t have consequences ?
No , it matters quite a bit , and I &apos;ll give you an example of why .
I put mine up on the screen to help you along .
The bottom line is , time is a powerful force .
It transforms our preferences .
It reshapes our values .
It alters our personalities .
It &apos;s as if , for most of us , the present is a magic time .
It &apos;s a watershed on the timeline .
It &apos;s the moment at which we finally become ourselves .
The one constant in our life is change .
Thank you .
But there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic .
Thank you .
Andrew Solomon : How the worst moments in our lives make us who we are
But over time , I &apos;ve come to feel that the truth is irrelevant .
We make those choices all our lives .
I survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance .
And I said , &quot; Pity ? &quot;
So as it turns out , I &apos;m the lucky one . &quot;
That became my mantra .
Forging meaning is about changing yourself .
Building identity is about changing the world .
It only makes what was wrong precious .
And that &apos;s what they did .
It took identity to rescue me from sadness .
Identity politics can be narcissistic .
It &apos;s a great idea , but its time has not yet come .
Perhaps I could .
And everyone turned around , startled .
I &apos;m glad we all get cake .
And I thought — Thank you .
Forge meaning . Build identity .
Forge meaning .
Build identity .
And then invite the world to share your joy .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
We have it backwards . Right ?
So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
Why did you do it ? &quot;
It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
So trust and cooperation are really important here .
It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
So where does that feeling come from ?
Nothing personal .
There are inherent benefits to this .
Bad system of survival .
The modern day is exactly the same thing .
Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
We have no control over these forces .
These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot;
And this is exactly what she said to me .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
We would never do it .
Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
None at all .
They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
And Bob refused .
You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
And so they came up with a furlough program .
I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Rives : The Museum of Four in the Morning
She &apos;s a Polish poet .
&quot; The hour from night to day .
The hour from side to side .
The hour for those past thirty ... &quot;
Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem ?
Groucho Marx : Charlie , you should have come to the first party .
We didn &apos;t get home till around four in the morning .
Rives : I would be listening to music , and this would happen .
That &apos;s how we did it in the pre-TED.com days .
It was fun . That was pretty much it .
A bunch of people sent me this when it came out .
More than one person sent me this .
Didi Pickles : It &apos;s four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding ?
Stu Pickles : Because I &apos;ve lost control of my life .
Ronnie : Not at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Those were all really solid examples .
But they followed the pattern . They played along .
I don &apos;t know anybody with juvenile diabetes .
People sent me magazine ads .
They took photographs in grocery stores .
I got a ton of graphic novels and comics .
A lot of good quality work , too : &quot; The Sandman , &quot; &quot; Watchmen . &quot;
There &apos;s a very cute example here from &quot; Calvin and Hobbes . &quot;
Take a look .
Wilma Flintstone : Like how early ?
Fred Flintstone : Like at 4 a.m. , that &apos;s how early .
: The time is 4 a.m.
Rives : It shows the spectrum .
Here &apos;s your sampler .
Secondly , I did a little research .
You know , I was kind of interested .
Literature probably shows it best .
There are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare .
There &apos;s a five in the morning .
There are seven four in the mornings , and they &apos;re all very dire .
In &quot; Measure for Measure , &quot; it &apos;s the call time for the executioner .
&quot; Lolita &quot; has as a creepy four in the morning .
&quot; Huckleberry Finn &quot; has one in dialect .
Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison &apos;s &quot; Invisible Man . &quot;
What kind of person would do that ?
This kind of person would do that .
Newcaster : Top of the hour . Time for the morning news .
But of course , there is no news yet .
Rives : Exactly .
And when I got to that point , I embraced it .
I started archiving .
Why &quot; Porn Star : Legend of Ron Jeremy &quot; ?
You can click on that red &quot; refresh &quot; button .
Rives : So the first hour of this project was satisfying .
I received a poignant tweet .
It was brief .
It just said , &quot; Reminds me of an ancient mix tape . &quot;
L.D. was my college romance .
I did this again last October .
And then I thought , &quot; Good for him . &quot;
&quot; PG &quot; is Slavic literature .
&quot; 7000 &quot; series Polish literature .
Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems .
Tristram Wyatt : The smelly mystery of the human pheromone
&quot; Pheromone &quot; is a very powerful word .
They &apos;ve got lots of syllables .
It &apos;s things like androstenol , androstenone or androstadienone .
You couldn &apos;t demonstrate it was chemical .
He analyzed it very carefully .
That &apos;s closing the circle .
What about humans ?
What &apos;s changed ? And of course , it &apos;s puberty .
There are , indeed , problems .
And the first of these is perhaps surprising .
It &apos;s all about culture .
It &apos;s ripe blue Stilton .
Every culture has its own special food and national delicacy .
You &apos;re part of the in-group .
The second thing is the sense of smell .
We don &apos;t just have one kind of receptor .
So it doesn &apos;t apply to 20 percent of the world .
I &apos;m fairly convinced that we do have them .
It &apos;s going to be difficult , it &apos;s going to be embarrassing , but we need to look .
There is one team that I &apos;m actually very impressed by .
So this is a baby having a drink of milk from its mother &apos;s breast .
It &apos;s a very interesting secretion .
The baby remains sleeping , showing no interest at all .
It &apos;s not about individual recognition .
Any mother will do .
Now , why is this important , apart from being simply very interesting ?
You &apos;ll be dead .
There could be all sorts of medical interventions .
So do go forward and do search for more .
There &apos;s lots to find .
Thank you very much .
So I did some calculations .
Can you do this one soon ?
So I decided to try to figure this out myself .
There are a few things that I looked at here .
I started with money .
So they go through a huge number of them .
You can also look at power .
How much room is that ?
How many server racks could you fit in there ?
And this is a lot of fun .
And there are some things I didn &apos;t look at .
So I came up with this estimate , and this is a staggering amount of data .
And I posted it on my website . I wrote it up .
And sometimes not .
Thank you .
Stanley McChrystal : The military case for sharing knowledge
It was security . It was protecting information .
But the question often came , who needed to know ?
And in a tightly coupled world , that &apos;s very hard to predict .
But what we found is we had to change .
We had to change our culture about information .
We had to knock down walls . We had to share .
But as I was talking to my intelligence officer , I said , &quot; What do we do ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , you found them . &quot; Our command .
And I said , &quot; Well , can we declassify them ?
And he says , &quot; They &apos;re their personnel records . &quot;
Thank you .
Stanley McChrystal : I think that Rick said something very important .
We , most people , don &apos;t know all the facts .
I think there are two parts of this .
HW : Thank you so much . Thank you .
Say hello to EDI .
Now he &apos;s asleep . Let &apos;s wake him up .
EDI , EDI .
Audiences marveled at the way they moved .
It comes from &quot; robota . &quot;
It means &quot; forced labor . &quot;
Marco Tempest : But these robots were not real .
They were not intelligent .
EDI is different .
EDI is real .
EDI : I am 176 centimeters tall .
MT : He weighs 300 pounds .
MT : We love robots .
EDI : Hi . I &apos;m EDI . Will you be my friend ?
It &apos;s one of the leitmotifs of science fiction .
That &apos;s not true of the robot .
Now , this goes both ways .
EDI : Wow !
MT : Robots cannot anticipate human actions .
Accidents are inevitable .
EDI : Ow ! That hurt .
Ready , EDI ? EDI : Uh , ready , Marco .
Abracadabra .
MT : Abracadabra ?
EDI : Yeah . It &apos;s all part of the illusion , Marco .
Come on , keep up .
Technology can do the same .
Thank you , Isaac Asimov .
MT : We anthropomorphize our machines .
We give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice .
EDI : I am EDI .
MT : We let them entertain us .
EDI : Marco , you &apos;re standing on my foot !
Thank you .
EDI : Thank you !
Mellody Hobson : Color blind or color brave ?
So it &apos;s 2006 .
My friend Harold Ford calls me .
You come with him . &quot;
Harold and I arrive in New York .
We are in our best suits .
We look like shiny new pennies .
She motions for us to follow her .
Just as this happens , my friend rushes in .
The blood drains from her face .
There are literally no words , right ?
You see , my mother was ruthlessly realistic .
I mean , why would anyone treat me differently ?
But she knew .
And so I decided to actually talk about race .
So that is a fact .
And I know how we got here .
I know how we got here .
You know , there was institutionalized , at one time legalized , discrimination in our country .
There &apos;s no question about it .
I tell the uniform story because it happened .
It doesn &apos;t mean that at all . It doesn &apos;t ensure it .
And every single time I failed , I had to start over .
And I failed a lot .
We cannot afford to be color blind .
We have to be color brave .
He runs ESPN .
And Skipper says his answers were always the same : &quot; Yes . &quot;
I think that &apos;s a part of the secret sauce .
There &apos;s a guy named Scott Page at the University of Michigan .
The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic .
What can I do ?
And I &apos;m telling you , you can be color brave .
I &apos;m asking you to look at the people around you purposefully and intentionally .
She was an unbelievable role model .
We take a stand . We show courage .
I &apos;m asking you to be bold .
As business leaders , I &apos;m asking you not to leave anything on the table .
As citizens , I &apos;m asking you not to leave any child behind .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thanks . Thanks .
There are 39 million people in the world who are blind .
The challenges were great .
When we got to where we were going , we set up our high-tech equipment .
Power was rarely available .
We &apos;d have to run our equipment from petrol power generators .
And the beauty is , anybody can do it .
And it costs just 500 dollars .
The issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar .
This is something that has to happen .
So here we have the Peek Vision app .
We can see all parts of the retina .
But now we can . Thank you .
The Olympic motto is &quot; Citius , Altius , Fortius . &quot;
Faster , Higher , Stronger .
And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
That &apos;s a lot in sprinter land .
Bang ! The gun goes off .
Usain Bolt starts to catch him .
That &apos;s the entire finish of the race .
You can open your eyes now .
That first beep was Usain Bolt .
That last beep was Jesse Owens .
Listen to it again .
Listen to it again .
Consider a longer event .
Nowadays , college kids do that every year .
Only 530 are left .
Take a look at the record for the 100-meter freestyle swim .
Where does the record stand today ?
And this showed in athletes &apos; bodies .
And this happened throughout the sports world .
Yours is probably very nearly so .
Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall , they are ludicrously long .
And the opposite is advantageous in running .
You want long legs and a short torso .
That &apos;s a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace .
That &apos;s from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta .
There &apos;s no explosion there .
They &apos;re essentially jumping .
That &apos;s the power that &apos;s contained in the human body .
But normally we can &apos;t access nearly all of it .
They have to run like this .
Have you ever looked at an ape &apos;s butt ?
They have no buns because they don &apos;t run upright .
Here &apos;s Kílian running up the Matterhorn .
With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist .
He &apos;s pulling up on a rope .
Amazing .
Changing technology , changing genes , and a changing mindset .
Thank you very much .
Wendy Chung : Autism — what we know
&quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Why did my child develop autism ? &quot;
But autism is not a single condition .
He &apos;s actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics .
He doesn &apos;t make eye contact .
Has that number been increasing dramatically over time ?
And a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism .
But let me be very clear : Vaccines do not cause autism .
So the question remains , what does cause autism ?
In fact , there &apos;s probably not one single answer .
Remarkably , though , it &apos;s not 100 percent .
Well , how genetic is it ?
And let me pose something that might not be intuitive .
On the other hand , there &apos;s 75 percent that we still haven &apos;t figured out .
They fit together in a pathway .
But early diagnosis is a key for us .
This baby we know is going to be in the clear .
On the other hand , this other baby is going to go on to develop autism .
How are we going to intervene ?
It &apos;s probably going to be a combination of factors .
But that &apos;s not going to be the only answer .
Beyond just drugs , we &apos;re going to use educational strategies .
They learn in a different way .
Thank you .
Elizabeth Gilbert : Success , failure and the drive to keep creating
And I said , &quot; Yes , I did . &quot;
So that &apos;s who I am .
I failed at getting published for almost six years .
And that &apos;s how I pushed through it .
She had failed constantly .
I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation .
We had nothing in common .
For me , that home has always been writing .
And you know what happened with that book ?
It bombed , and I was fine .
Thank you .
This one &apos;s called &quot; The Chase . &quot;
So here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
And this is a mapping application for disaster response .
This is a video chat application .
One example of those is protein folding .
Maybe this is the computer of the future .
There &apos;s no touchscreen .
There &apos;s no technology visible at all .
Thank you .
Hamish Jolly : A shark-deterrent wetsuit
And when we do , the results will often surprise .
And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
on the doorstep here , with the Oceans Institute .
And we did three key things .
We did that genetically and we did that anatomically .
And here &apos;s an example of one of the first drawings .
So this is what I call a &quot; don &apos;t eat me &quot; wetsuit .
And this one &apos;s configured to go with a surfboard .
So we knew that we had some really solid science here .
We can &apos;t put humans in the water .
It &apos;ll be an ongoing process .
It &apos;s subject to peer review and subject to publication .
It &apos;s so important that this concept is led with the science .
We &apos;ll license others to do that .
And Eduardo .
Cheers , mate .
Cheers .
Thanks , gentlemen . So what have we done here ?
Thank you .
Sarah Lewis : Embrace the near win
I learned so much from her .
This is a question I &apos;ve long asked myself .
For three hours this went on .
Mastery is not just the same as excellence , though .
Mastery is in the reaching , not the arriving .
We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge .
It &apos;s called the Dunning – Kruger effect .
And this is what a near win does .
This is the dynamic of mastery .
Thank you .
The universe is teeming with planets .
We &apos;ve only detected them indirectly .
Now let &apos;s move ten times further away .
Here we are at the orbit of Uranus .
Now it &apos;s not resolved at all .
It &apos;s that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan &apos;s .
But let &apos;s move yet again ten times further away .
One more time , ten times further away .
The light from the star is diffracting .
We have to get rid of it .
You &apos;ve all seen that . That &apos;s a solar eclipse .
The moon has moved in front of the sun .
It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it .
Well , what &apos;s going on ?
Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth .
Spitzer &apos;s suggestion was we do this in space .
Well that would look something like this .
But Spitzer actually knew the answer .
It looks something like that .
We call that our flower petal starshade .
That , of course , has to be bigger than my thumb .
It starts wrapped around a hub .
It separates from the telescope .
The petals unfurl , they open up , the telescope turns around .
Boom , we get planets orbiting about it .
Thank you .
That &apos;s not science fiction .
So those are four petals .
This is a sub-scale star shade .
You &apos;ll see the petals unfurl .
Now you &apos;re seeing it deploy .
Those petals have to rotate into place .
I think this is the coolest possible science .
That will change everything when we see that .
Thank you .
Thank you for indulging me .
I have always wanted to do that .
All of these books are well-intentioned .
I am sure that many of them are great .
I see anxiety .
Their marital satisfaction is lower .
Who are on par with strangers . &quot;
But here &apos;s the thing .
Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed .
The roles of our children have changed .
So how did we get here ?
Kids were considered economic assets .
And thank God it did .
The world is changing so rapidly , it &apos;s impossible to say .
This was true even when I was young .
I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef .
And you know what ? I &apos;m doing okay .
I pay my taxes .
I hold down a steady job .
I was even invited to speak at TED .
Guess what it was ?
Dad in a room by himself .
But here is the thing : Men are doing plenty .
They are truly improvising as they go .
But it is a very elusive one .
It &apos;s not like teaching them how to ride a bike .
There &apos;s no curriculum for it .
Can I just repeat that ?
The content of the original &quot; Sesame Street &quot; is not suitable for children .
Bad modeling . I don &apos;t know .
I cannot tell you how much this distresses me .
The offending muppet , right there .
That &apos;s my son the day he was born .
I was high as a kite on morphine .
I had had an unexpected C-section .
I whispered it into his ear .
That , anyway , is one response to having no script .
Thank you .
Adam I is the worldly , ambitious , external side of our nature .
He wants to build , create , create companies , create innovation .
Adam II is the humble side of our nature .
Adam I wants to conquer the world .
Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world .
Adam I savors accomplishment .
Adam II savors inner consistency and strength .
Adam I asks how things work .
Adam II asks why we &apos;re here .
Adam I &apos;s motto is &quot; success . &quot;
You have to give to receive .
You have to conquer the desire to get what you want .
In order to fulfill yourself , you have to forget yourself .
In order to find yourself , you have to lose yourself .
You don &apos;t have the depth of conviction .
You don &apos;t have an emotional sonorousness .
Adam I is built by building on your strengths .
People don &apos;t realize that .
I certainly didn &apos;t .
Gabby Giffords : Yes .
She didn &apos;t have much other information .
She just said , &quot; Gabby was shot . &quot;
PM : And there were certain words , too .
Yeah , that was it .
GG : Talking . Really hard . Really .
I do .
She works incredibly hard every day .
Yeah , Gabby , she used to race motorcycles .
So you meet .
What attracts you to Gabby ?
Gabby would — GG : Fact-finding mission .
GG : No , no , no .
A good friend .
Yeah , we were friends for a long time .
Where &apos;d we go , Gabby ?
GG : Death row .
So that was our first date .
I guess .
GG : Um , good friends . Best friends . Best friends .
I thought we always had a very special relationship .
Actually , you didn &apos;t even live together .
What did you like best about being in Congress ?
GG : Fast pace . Fast pace .
Gabby &apos;s in a coma . I &apos;m in Tucson .
You &apos;ve got to find a replacement for me . &quot;
But I knew she was — GG : Yes . Yes . Yes .
PM : Is that for appetizer or dessert , Mark ?
Well , it just gets the conversation going .
GG : The debt ceiling . The debt ceiling .
What &apos;s life like , day to day ?
GG : Nelson .
New member of our family . GG : Yes , yes .
PM : Your relationship is deeper .
I imagine being grateful , too , right ?
GG : Grateful .
GG : I want to make the world a better place .
And Gabby , what &apos;s on the agenda now ?
GG : Americans for Responsible Solutions .
We &apos;re trying to change that .
It &apos;s not too difficult to do that .
PM : Thank you both for that effort .
Take a look at Gabby .
This is a couple months ago .
Good stuff . Gorgeous . Oh , thank you .
Mountains . Gorgeous mountains .
He started doing better .
So they have a very , very nice connection .
GG : Yes .
PM : What a wonderful moment .
GG : Thank you .
Hello , everyone .
Thank you for inviting us here today .
But my spirit is strong as ever .
Get involved with your community .
Be a leader . Set an example .
Be passionate . Be courageous .
Thank you . GG : Thank you .
Thank you everybody . GG : Bye bye .
David Sengeh : The sore problem of prosthetic limbs
Thank you very much .
Hidden miracles of the natural world
What is the intersection between technology , art and science ?
We can do the same thing with ships at sea .
This is the egg of a butterfly .
Can you guess what this is ?
Shark skin .
A caterpillar &apos;s mouth .
The eye of a fruit fly .
An eggshell .
A flea .
A snail &apos;s tongue .
We &apos;ll just have to see .
Thank you .
Christopher Emdin : Teach teachers how to create magic
Right now .
They may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education .
And that to me is sad .
I &apos;m going to paraphrase Mark Twain .
Guess where those places are ?
And I &apos;ve been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy .
Who here has been to a black church ?
We got a couple of hands .
So he says , &quot; Can I get an amen ? &quot;
Audience : Amen .
Chris Emdin : So I can I get an amen ? Audience : Amen .
CE : And all of a sudden , everybody &apos;s reawoken .
That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention .
Now people oftentimes say , &quot; Well , magic is just magic . &quot;
Magic can be taught .
Magic can be taught .
Now , how do you teach it ?
They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage .
Thank you .
They are what makes it come alive .
And it was green .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s not how cities were being designed .
So here you see a familiar sight .
I mean , where would you sit here ?
What would you do here ?
But architects love them .
They are plinths for their creations .
And for developers , they are ideal .
Now , open spaces in cities are opportunities .
So we came up with a radical , almost insane idea .
Well , I didn &apos;t have any idea .
And what about cars ?
Our city couldn &apos;t possibly handle any more cars .
So what were we going to do ?
So here was the answer to our puzzle .
So how was I going to get this done ?
It &apos;s not something you can just fake .
And so I began walking .
I had to have faith .
And here is a new park in lower Manhattan .
And it did .
I really love this park .
So what &apos;s the trick ?
You don &apos;t tap into your design expertise .
You tap into your humanity .
I mean , would you want to go there ?
Would you want to stay there ?
Can you see into it and out of it ?
Are there other people there ?
Does it seem green and friendly ?
Can you find your very own seat ?
Well no , it would not be terrific .
It would be a mall , and not a park .
Perhaps it was just in their way .
People stay because they are having a great time .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Lawrence Lessig : The unstoppable walk to political reform
So a chip , a poet and a boy .
So there was a revolution across the world .
Number two , a poet .
This is Martin Niemöller .
You &apos;re familiar with his poetry .
Then they came for the socialists .
Then they came for the trade unions .
Then they came for the Jews .
And then they came for me .
But there was no one left to speak for me . &quot;
Now , Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight .
This is an insight at the core of intelligence .
We could call it cluefulness .
Can you save yourself or save your kind ?
Turns out ants are pretty good at this .
Cows , not so much .
So can you see the pattern ?
Number three , a boy .
This is my friend Aaron Swartz .
He &apos;s Tim &apos;s friend .
It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk .
So I was a little put off by this .
He wasn &apos;t sharing in my celebration .
I said , &quot; Yeah , as an academic , it &apos;s not my field . &quot;
He said , &quot; What about as a citizen ?
As a citizen . &quot;
Now , this is the way Aaron was .
He didn &apos;t tell . He asked questions .
He was saying to me , &quot; You &apos;ve got to get a clue .
It is every time , every single important issue .
I couldn &apos;t begin to describe the sadness .
Because I had to focus .
It saved me .
She started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington , D.C.
Hope .
I loved that boy like I love my son .
But we failed him .
I &apos;m not going to fail that .
What &apos;s next ?
And then finally number three , the hardest .
We &apos;re in the age of the Super PAC .
It is now an official word in the dictionary .
And the basic way this works is this .
What is that number ? Half a billion ? A billion ?
What is that number ?
So last night , we heard about wishes .
Here &apos;s my wish .
May one .
May one .
Aaron asked me that .
Now I &apos;ve asked you .
Thank you very much .
Facebook has 1.2 billion users per month .
So this is Target , the company .
Yeah , the dad was really upset .
We can do all of this really well .
If you Google this , you &apos;ll find it .
It &apos;s four pages , easy to read .
So this is something we &apos;ve studied for a long time .
We have good models of it .
So this is pretty complicated stuff , right ?
And I see that as a real problem going forward .
We totally can do that now .
That seems to me to be a problem .
So one of the paths we can go down is the policy and law path .
so users control their data .
So that gives us an advantage over the law side .
Thank you .
So , this is an interview with a difference .
So , we &apos;re going to start here .
Melinda Gates : With those big glasses , huh ?
We were already engaged to be married .
It was incredible . Bill had never taken that much time off from work .
We started asking ourselves questions .
Does it have to be like this ?
Were there things that weren &apos;t being done ?
There was a lot we didn &apos;t know .
Our naïveté is pretty incredible , when we look back on it .
So it started there , but it got accelerated .
In the U.S. , you just go down to the drug store . &quot;
How on Earth do you decide what to focus on ?
What &apos;s this about ?
I don &apos;t tell them who I am . Pair of khakis .
and others supported .
How do you navigate that ?
Well , my graph has numbers on it .
I really like this graph .
So this is a story largely of vaccines .
Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year .
That was eradicated , so that got down to zero .
That &apos;s down to a few hundred thousand .
We can actually accelerate the progress .
It &apos;s not reported .
Does that drive you crazy ?
Yeah , because it &apos;s a silent thing going on .
It &apos;s a kid , one kid at a time .
These causes have been a bit invisible .
You should look at , what was your goal ?
We can spend aid smarter .
It is not all a panacea .
How have you guys managed it ?
That just wouldn &apos;t work out . &quot;
He &apos;s going to listen and be really interested .
But now you are , and we &apos;re very happy that you are .
Melinda , early on , you were basically largely running the show .
I was actually really excited .
That &apos;s cool .
Including some of the employees .
She &apos;s got a lot of insight .
She &apos;ll sit down with the employees a lot .
So there &apos;s a lot of collaboration .
MG : Well , here &apos;s the thing .
For me , I come at it from intuition .
What about failure , though ?
Well , we got hundreds of ideas .
Maybe a few of those will work out .
Are there any failures that you can talk about ?
They bring down the dropout rate .
They have less violence and crime in those schools .
MG : So we went to Tanzania .
Jenn &apos;s been to Tanzania .
All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit , actually .
Anna and Sanare are the parents .
They invited us to come and stay in their boma .
It was a very loving relationship .
She was very , very shy .
So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn .
Oh , wow .
How have you managed it ?
What &apos;s been your approach ?
MG : Well , it &apos;s interesting .
Is that your plan for them ?
How on Earth did that happen ?
I guess there &apos;s a long version and a short version of that .
We &apos;ve got time for the short version .
Yes .
How is that going ?
Well , we &apos;ve got about 120 people who have now taken this giving pledge .
We &apos;re not trying to homogenize it .
People give to some things .
We look and go , &quot; Wow . &quot;
But that &apos;s great .
We need more experimentation .
To me , that &apos;s the piece that &apos;s incredible .
I &apos;m curious , can you make the pitch ?
What &apos;s the pitch ?
Is that a fair comment ?
It tries to balance out , and that &apos;s just .
MG : But you change systems .
That &apos;s the most important .
Thank you . MG : Thank you .
Thank you . MG : Thank you very much .
All right , good job .
It &apos;s now 2.7 degrees .
But it &apos;s not exactly 2.7 degrees .
It &apos;s only 2.7 degrees to about 10 parts in a million .
What happens ? It rings .
Those waves have long since faded .
If you go for a walk , you don &apos;t wiggle .
And that amazes me .
Thanks a lot .
TED staff : It &apos;s TED , the Musical
Daffodil Hudson : Hello ?
Yeah , this is she .
What ?
Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , of course I accept .
What are the dates again ?
Pen . Pen . Pen .
March 17 through 21 .
Okay , all right , great . Thanks .
Lab Partner : Who was that ?
DH : It was TED .
LP : Who &apos;s TED ?
DH : I &apos;ve got to prepare .
Can I help you ?
DH : Right now ?
Stagehand : Break a leg .
Del Harvey : Protecting Twitter users
Let &apos;s talk about what scale looks like at Twitter .
We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes .
That &apos;s a 24,900-percent increase .
There &apos;s no risk involved .
My job is to root out and prevent activity that might .
Sounds straightforward , right ?
It &apos;s the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale .
Say 99.999 percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone .
There &apos;s no threat involved .
The sheer scale of what we &apos;re dealing with makes for a challenge .
You know what else makes my role particularly challenging ?
People do weird things .
We &apos;ll start off easy .
Let &apos;s look at spam .
Seems pretty straightforward .
We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior .
Turns out there &apos;s some exceptions to that rule .
Okay . Let &apos;s make the stakes higher .
This time it &apos;s sending the same message and link .
That &apos;s pretty clearly not a good thing .
We want to , and do , suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior .
So why are the stakes higher for this ?
So what do I do ?
I visualize catastrophe .
What do I mean by &quot; visualize catastrophe ? &quot;
Which happens to be my next example .
This is my cat , Eli .
You only get 140 characters .
My job isn &apos;t to think of those .
It &apos;s to think of what could go wrong .
Well , here &apos;s one possibility .
There &apos;s more in that picture than just a cat .
There &apos;s geodata .
It &apos;s not .
Thank you .
But why do these groups form ?
And that is often not the case .
This is Artemia , a brine shrimp .
You probably know it better as a sea monkey .
These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm .
As a freelance journalist , I sympathize .
The shrimp are just one step on its journey .
It &apos;s not safety in numbers .
It &apos;s actually the exact opposite .
This is a suicidal cricket .
The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone .
And I &apos;ve been writing about these creatures ever since .
Because after all , they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre .
But there &apos;s more to it than that .
Is it maybe protecting its siblings ?
No .
See what I mean ?
Now , the caterpillar didn &apos;t die .
Manipulation is not an oddity .
And this is one of my favorite examples .
It doesn &apos;t kill the roach , nor does it sedate it .
These hosts won &apos;t get to survive or reproduce .
Now humans , of course , are no stranger to manipulation .
If there are any — I &apos;ve got a red dot on my forehead now , don &apos;t I ?
If there are any , this is a good candidate for them .
The cat eats the rat . Toxo gets to have sex .
It &apos;s a classic tale of Eat , Prey , Love .
You &apos;re very charitable , generous people .
Hi , Elizabeth , I loved your talk .
How does the parasite control its host in this way ?
We don &apos;t really know .
What is clear is that this thing is a single cell .
This has no nervous system . It has no consciousness .
It doesn &apos;t even have a body .
But it &apos;s manipulating a mammal ?
We are mammals .
Now typically , this doesn &apos;t lead to any overt illness .
The parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long period of time .
Thank you .
Good morning .
In our home , art was everywhere .
I found these objects both useful and fascinating .
Life was good .
But I wondered , what about when it rained ?
But the ceiling was amazing .
It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome .
I loved this place .
He said , &quot; About 2,000 years ago . &quot;
He said , &quot; It &apos;s the original roof . &quot;
To build the Pantheon took some miracles .
For example , here are some of the Pantheon &apos;s miracles .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the quota .
Take the oculus of the Pantheon .
Not bad .
Enough ancient history .
So what came after the moon ?
The Internet isn &apos;t a Pantheon .
The smartphone is a perfect example .
So what &apos;s next ?
What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon ?
It is a different kind of language , like art .
So what is next ?
Now you &apos;re thinking , give me a break .
Occasionally , humans will need to do sense-making .
But these people don &apos;t spontaneously pop into existence .
They are in fact essential to what makes us special .
Thank you .
The problem is anonymous companies .
It sounds like a really dry and technical thing , doesn &apos;t it ?
But why does the Earth go around the sun ?
But why is blood red ?
But why do I have to go to school ?
But why do I have to respect the teachers and authority ?
And in particular , we were talking about the civil war in Cambodia .
And we &apos;re all driven by the same belief , that change really is possible .
So , what exactly does Global Witness do ?
And then we campaign hard to change the system itself .
And one of these is anonymous companies .
That &apos;s twice the country &apos;s health and education budget combined .
Well , that uses anonymous companies too .
And really , that is unfair .
Well , the answer is , yes you can .
Well first you need to work out where you want to set it up .
But don &apos;t worry , it doesn &apos;t have to be your name .
And then you add the owner of the company .
It could be another company .
Well , that &apos;s no problem either .
But whose interests is this all serving ?
And what does it all mean for us ?
It was the night before New Year &apos;s Eve .
Over 200 people died .
Seven hundred were injured trying to get out .
And so I come to my wish .
So what might this look like ?
So how are we going to do this ?
Well , there is only one way .
There is such an opportunity right now .
You really can make this change happen .
The U.K. government is already on board ; it supports these public registries .
That is momentum .
But it &apos;s early days .
This isn &apos;t just a dry policy issue .
This is a human issue which affects us all .
Together , let &apos;s kickstart this global movement .
Let &apos;s just do it , let &apos;s end anonymous companies .
Thank you .
What &apos;s the scariest thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
And why did you do it ?
And we &apos;re alive .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
But why would we take that risk ?
Why would you do something that dangerous ?
In my case the answer is fairly straightforward .
I was thinking , what do I do next ?
Maybe it &apos;s spiders .
A lot of people are afraid of spiders .
And how do you know ?
The danger is entirely different than the fear .
How do you get around it , though ?
How do you change your behavior ?
And you can apply this to anything .
It would make you nervous and worried .
He could come over and help me . &quot;
I could find my own way back .
It &apos;s not nearly as big a deal .
What is the real thing that you should be afraid of ?
Not just a generic fear of bad things happening .
It &apos;s time to come home at the end .
Just to finish , they asked me to play that guitar .
That &apos;s very nice of you . Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Carin Bondar : The birds and the bees are just the beginning
Yeah , you did .
Thank you for putting your hand up over there .
Penile diversity is especially profuse .
So this is a paper nautilus .
Just what is a hectocotylus ?
A detachable , swimming penis .
Now , the tapir is a mammal from South America .
And the tapir has a prehensile penis .
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands .
And these contributions are far from equal .
And quite frankly , that &apos;s exactly what it is .
But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that .
Why do they do this ?
Mm-hm .
A little guppy porn for you right there .
We &apos;ve seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex .
I mean , imagine putting a penis into another penis .
It &apos;s simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action .
In hyena societies , adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale .
So what are my take-home messages from my talk today ?
So thank you , and happy daydreaming .
Anne-Marie Slaughter : Can we all &quot; have it all &quot; ?
So my moment of truth did not come all at once .
The woman I thought I was would have said yes .
But the real change came more gradually .
The best companies actually know this .
They &apos;re psychiatrists .
Or who has the most flexible boss ?
It &apos;s certainly not complete .
And as many women hold that view as men do .
For a man , that &apos;s a risky proposition .
I can almost hear lots of you thinking , &quot; No way . &quot;
But in fact , the change is actually already happening .
They are in the birthing rooms .
Bill Gates agrees .
Today , not so much .
It is happening .
It will happen .
How far and how fast is up to us .
Thank you .
I work with children with autism .
Specifically , I make technologies to help them communicate .
And because of this , they have a lot of difficulty with language .
Let me tell you a little bit about why this is .
You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup .
So Avaz is essentially converting pictures , it &apos;s a translator , it converts pictures into speech .
Now , this was very effective .
Let me explain this in a little more detail .
Take this sentence : &quot; I want soup tonight . &quot;
Now , this is what we call grammar .
in order to convey anything you want to .
The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective .
So she asked , &quot; Eat what ? Do you want to eat ice cream ?
You want to eat ? Somebody else wants to eat ?
It &apos;s what comes after thought but before language .
And the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form .
And I found that this is not enough .
Why is this not enough ?
You do that by changing the word &quot; want . &quot;
It &apos;s a past tense .
So this is a flourish which I added to make the system complete .
It &apos;s a fairly complicated sentence .
I &apos;m going to start with the word &quot; tell . &quot;
So this is the word &quot; tell . &quot;
I &apos;m going to ask questions .
So , who told ? I told .
I told whom ? I told the carpenter .
Couldn &apos;t pay whom ? I couldn &apos;t pay the carpenter .
I told the carpenter I could not pay him .
And there are two or three interesting things about this .
First of all , I could have started anywhere .
I didn &apos;t have to start with the word &quot; tell . &quot;
I was trying out so many different combinations of this .
And so this gave me this idea .
And so I tried a number of experiments .
All right , let &apos;s talk about something else .
Let &apos;s talk about speech .
So speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us .
Now what &apos;s interesting about speech is that speech is one-dimensional .
Why is it one-dimensional ? It &apos;s one-dimensional because it &apos;s sound .
It &apos;s also one-dimensional because our mouths are built that way .
Our mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound .
I mean , we have these rich , complicated , multi-dimensional ideas .
Take Google , for example .
What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead ?
Instead they &apos;re processing the data structure of thought .
The data structure of thought .
That &apos;s a provocative idea .
But let &apos;s look at this in a little more detail .
So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem .
FreeSpeech , I told you , is completely language-independent .
It doesn &apos;t have any specific information in it which is about English .
That &apos;s a pretty interesting concept in itself .
it &apos;s actually not very complicated .
And that gives this interesting idea .
I mean , this is an incredibly attractive idea , especially for India .
We have so many different languages .
That means &quot; ever-smiling speaker of beautiful languages . &quot;
Language is beautiful .
I think it &apos;s the most beautiful of human creations .
I think it &apos;s the loveliest thing that our brains have invented .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
So , how big ?
Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
might be answered by studying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very hot .
This is in false color .
It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
Third thing : probing the very small .
You were lied to .
And dark matter is no exception .
Well , how do we do this ?
Here is an image .
So , it &apos;s very funny .
Fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
And , again , we want to learn more about it .
Here is a computer simulation .
And we need a way to simplify it .
Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
They are not faster horses .
They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
All right . Are you with me ? Yeah . Yeah . All right .
Okay . Pretty much everybody .
I see one guy there .
It doesn &apos;t count if it was you , sir .
Sitting next to a loud guy .
Now what does this tell us ?
So I thought , got to talk about that .
We &apos;ll get back to that a little bit later .
The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA , according to this vision . Right ?
And there &apos;s really no argument about this among anthropologists .
All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality .
There were no strangers . Right ?
In a hunter-gatherer band , there are no strangers .
But I &apos;m not saying they were having sex with strangers .
I &apos;m not saying that they didn &apos;t love the people they were having sex with .
And I &apos;m not saying there was no pair-bonding going on .
I &apos;m just saying it wasn &apos;t sexually exclusive .
Okay ? So this is my point .
This is vanishingly rare among mammals .
So what we &apos;re talking about is sperm competition .
There &apos;s a lot to talk about in this chart .
That indicates female copulatory vocalization .
Just look at the numbers .
We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos .
That &apos;s what the external testicles are .
I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s true .
Now , this evidence goes way beyond anatomy .
It goes into anthropology as well .
These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China .
There &apos;s no shame associated with sexual behavior .
Women have hundreds of partners .
It doesn &apos;t matter . Nobody cares . Nobody gossips . It &apos;s not an issue .
The biological father is a nonissue .
Now , why does this matter ?
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Christopher Ryan : Thank you .
So a question .
How is that different from the talk you gave ?
But that &apos;s just an example .
Everyone has to respond to the modern world .
But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to get at .
Thank you . Communicated powerfully . Thanks a lot .
CR : Thank you , Chris .
Molly Stevens : A new way to grow bone
Take , for example , this beautiful blue nacre shell .
This was actually used by the Mayans as an artificial tooth replacement .
We &apos;re not quite sure why they did it .
It &apos;s hard . It &apos;s durable .
But it also had other very nice properties .
They &apos;ve taken things off the shelf .
Their very purpose was to perform a mechanical function .
We have cells there , typically from the patient .
And bone is actually quite good at repairing .
And I &apos;ll talk you through this .
That layer is called the periosteum .
We &apos;ve lots of blood vessels in there .
But there &apos;s a difference here .
And so for that , I &apos;d like to thank all of you as well .
Thank you .
Rupal Patel : Synthetic voices , as unique as fingerprints
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to share with you .
Rupal Patel : That was the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking .
So why then the same prosthetic voice ?
I want you to take a listen to how they sound .
They &apos;re saying the same utterance .
So I reached out to my collaborator , Tim Bunnell .
So we decided to do exactly that .
Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults .
We &apos;ve all experienced this .
And that happens in one individual .
It &apos;s that simple .
That &apos;s the science behind what we &apos;re doing .
Well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate .
It &apos;s not such an ominous thing .
The process goes something like this .
Voice : Things happen in pairs .
I love to sleep .
The sky is blue without clouds .
We &apos;re going to call this database a voice bank .
Voice : I love chocolate .
RP : So that &apos;s speech synthesis .
It &apos;s called concatenative synthesis , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re using .
That &apos;s not the novel part .
This is Samantha .
It &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s exactly that .
Samantha : Aaaaaah .
RP : So now , Samantha can say this .
Samantha : This voice is only for me .
But there &apos;s so much more work to be done .
They say that giving blood can save lives .
So that &apos;s the science behind what we &apos;re doing .
I wondered , what was he thinking ?
Imagine that .
Thank you .
Chris McKnett : The investment logic for sustainability
Let me remind you what we already know .
So the views of CEOs are clear .
There &apos;s tremendous opportunity in sustainability .
One example is near and dear to our hearts .
So awesome , right ?
Another example is Pentair .
I mean , come on , really ?
The answer that may surprise you is yes .
In blue , we see the MSCI World .
Hesta .
You gotta love the Aussies , right ?
CalPERS is another example .
and the sixth largest in the world .
This is why we are concerned with ESG . &quot;
They &apos;re compatible .
So I &apos;m not talking about tradeoffs here .
Why do they hold the key ?
The answer , quite simply , is , they have the money .
A lot of it .
I mean , a really lot of it .
The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars .
The global bond market , 78 trillion .
That &apos;s 133 trillion combined .
That &apos;s eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.
That &apos;s the world &apos;s largest economy .
That &apos;s some serious freaking firepower .
What if there isn &apos;t enough clean air and fresh water ?
Thank you .
Aparna Rao : Art that craves your attention
So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
So this is the sketch of the two states .
One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
So here &apos;s a video .
The next work is Decoy .
So here is the first test scenario .
The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
And here is a prototype .
Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
It comes out of the idea of a window .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
Thank you .
Teddy Cruz : How architectural innovations migrate across borders
What do I mean by the informal in this case ?
So these are houses waiting to cross the border .
This layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice .
I don &apos;t want to romanticize poverty .
With shovels in hand , they started to dig .
Two weeks later , the police stopped them .
They came to the city attorney &apos;s office .
Now for many of you , this story might seem trivial or naive .
Thank you .
Server : May I help you , sir ?
Customer : Uh , let &apos;s see .
Server : Would you like any desserts , sir ?
Our special is tracking cookie .
Customer : I &apos;d like a batch of some zombie tracking cookies , thank you .
Server : Coming right up , sir .
Your food will be served shortly .
And thus , &quot; Malicious Dishes &quot; was born .
That started my love for technology .
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators !
Ideas can spark a movement .
Ideas are opportunities and innovation .
Ideas truly are what make the world go round .
And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
And I thought , I can start my own business .
Soon , my business really started to take off .
For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
Thank you , and peace and blessings .
Please , Mr. and Mrs. Penn . Would you just -- Ah !
But first , what do we call complexity ?
What is complex ?
Well , complex is not complicated .
These are Scottish terriers .
In the beginning , the system is disorganized .
Then comes a perturbation : milk .
So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room .
It turned out , the light in that room was slightly different .
The robot &apos;s vision system got confused .
Which brings us to bats .
They are very social animals .
Mostly they roost , or sleep , together .
It turns out this is a very interesting picture .
We call them cryptic social units .
And this is where complexity brings an answer .
It &apos;s a mathematical model , but it &apos;s not complicated .
Simple , individual rules .
But it gets better .
And I find this incredible .
I &apos;m sure you know meerkats .
They &apos;re fascinating creatures .
They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy .
In the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road .
On this road there are cars , so it &apos;s dangerous .
It &apos;s a simplistic model .
They simply move together .
Thank you .
Nicolas Perony : I &apos;m okay , thanks .
But is it okay to do these associations ?
So that &apos;s it .
Thank you , Nicolas Perony .
So I have a brother , Gavin .
He loved to cook .
He wanted to be a chef really badly .
But then he started to realize something .
And this discouraged my brother a lot .
So this petition started to take off -- humongously fast , you have no idea .
Thank you .
So , let &apos;s see .
But then I started to realize something .
Haters gonna hate .
And you can make that change .
Thank you .
Anant Agarwal : Why massive open online courses matter
I &apos;d like to reimagine education .
It starts with an M.
MOOC : massive open online courses .
What &apos;s changed ?
The seats are in color .
Whoop-de-do .
Education really hasn &apos;t changed in the past 500 years .
Everything else has changed around us .
It &apos;s also been a real issue in terms of access .
It &apos;s like going from ox carts to the airplane .
Even the infrastructure has to change .
Everything has to change .
We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification .
Everything really has to change .
And we had no marketing budget .
Now , 155,000 is a big number .
7,200 is also a big number .
I call it teen-lish .
It &apos;s a digital language .
&quot; Honey , come over for dinner . &quot;
&quot; Hmm . &quot;
&quot; Did you hear me ? &quot;
Silence . &quot; Can you listen to me ? &quot;
I texted her . I got an instant response .
I said , this is great .
And so since then , our life has changed .
I text her , she responds .
It &apos;s just been absolutely great .
So our millennial generation is built differently .
But our kids are really different .
The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology .
So why are we fighting it in the classroom ?
Let &apos;s not fight it . Let &apos;s embrace it .
So here &apos;s what we can do .
They can solve problems together .
We were also doing other pilots .
You &apos;ll hear that a lot . That course has become sort of like our petri dish of learning .
Now don &apos;t take these results to the bank just yet .
So the results can be extremely , extremely good .
What are some key ideas that makes all of this work ?
One idea is active learning .
Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises .
Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education .
You teach by asking questions .
The second idea is self-pacing .
They can hit the pause button .
They can rewind the professor .
Heck , they can even mute the professor .
So this form of self-pacing can be very helpful to learning .
The third idea that we have is instant feedback .
the computer grades exercises .
I mean , how else do you teach 150,000 students ?
Your computer is grading all the exercises .
Some are never graded .
So with instant feedback , students can try to apply answers .
If they get it wrong , they can get instant feedback .
The next big idea is gamification .
You know , all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on .
How do you teach creativity ? How do you teach design ?
And this can also be graded by the computer .
Fifth is peer learning .
Let me tell you a story .
They had answered questions for 100 students .
How do you do that for 150,000 ?
had popped in with a different answer .
Now this is all not just in the future .
This is happening today .
I would like us to really reimagine education .
We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces .
The Aakash is 40 dollars .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
I have worked with more than 500 companies .
Disengaging their colleagues .
Acting against the interest of their company .
The way we organize is based on two pillars .
The hard -- structure , processes , systems .
They are obsolete .
We need quality , cost , reliability , speed .
The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization .
Let &apos;s take an example .
You have Mr. Noise , Mr. Petrol Consumption , Mr. Anti-Collision Properties .
What happens when the new requirement emerges ?
So , what was the solution using the hard approach ?
And Mr. Repairability creates the repairability process .
That came on top of 25 other KPIs .
It is basically the interplay .
How the parts work together .
The connections , the interactions , the synapses .
You know , the repairability issue is a cooperation problem .
Who will pay for that ?
Shareholders ? Customers ?
No , they will refuse .
Stress , burnout , they are overwhelmed , accidents .
No wonder they disengage .
They create a middle office .
What happens one year later ?
Plus I have to pay for the middle office .
The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation .
It is totally wrong .
It is even counterproductive .
Look , at home I have two TVs . Why ?
Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife .
Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife .
Definitely , these approaches are obsolete .
Simple rule number one : Understand what others do .
What is their real work ?
Second , you need to reenforce integrators .
By removing layers .
And we end up with the Encyclopedia Britannica of rules .
Otherwise , they will withdraw . They will disengage .
You can increase the shadow of the future .
We will cooperate .
Remove the second TV .
It changes everything .
On human resource management practices .
Complicatedness : This is your battle , business leaders .
The real battle is not against competitors .
This is rubbish , very abstract .
When do we meet competitors to fight them ?
Thank you .
Guy Hoffman : Robots with &quot; soul &quot;
So I made a really bad career decision .
And that &apos;s what my mom was like when I did it .
As kind of like a backdrop to show how bad things are .
And the second , was something one of our teachers told us .
And then put it back in your character .
And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop .
So you can see my confusion here .
I &apos;m not an actor .
And it &apos;s the same structure , just the motion is different .
He was already dead !
Just laying there , eyes glazed over ! &quot;
It was after a Passover seder .
Everybody did their own part .
We didn &apos;t have to divide our tasks .
We didn &apos;t have to communicate verbally about this .
It all just happened .
And then the human waits , until it &apos;s their turn again .
It became very popular in the 20th century .
And method acting said , you don &apos;t have to plan every muscle in your body .
Instead you have to use your body to find the right movement .
Improvise , play off yor scene partner .
And it was like a lightning bolt .
I went back to my office .
Let &apos;s look at it .
So , I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot .
It waits for its turn , it analyzes everything , it plans .
Let &apos;s call it the calculated brain .
The other got more the stage actor , risk taker brain .
Let &apos;s call it the adventurous brain .
It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know .
It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them .
Whatever that means .
Sounds painful .
It only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more .
So let &apos;s look at a few seconds from this performance .
Where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises .
We are wired for that .
This time it wasn &apos;t a desk lamp ; it was a speaker dock .
So , a lot of bobbing head .
And it &apos;s not just fun and games .
Somewhere in your future there &apos;s going to be a robot in your life .
And if not in yours , then in your children &apos;s lives .
Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise .
Thank you .
It &apos;s so not my regular experience , as I know anyone else &apos;s .
But I also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
Felling like I didn &apos;t belong there , feeling guilty to this day .
Have you seen changes ?
But what really matters to me , and I think all of us , is action .
You know , 500 times roughly 10 .
PM : Wow , that &apos;s amazing .
I met one of them , I was in Beijing .
And I kind of just started crying .
That &apos;s the kind of change we have to hope for .
Men only .
And we know there are groups all the way to Ethiopia .
And it &apos;s part of what TEDWomen does .
And you know what we found ?
Seventy-seven cents to the dollar .
If you are a black woman , 64 cents .
Do you know when the last time those numbers went up ?
2002 .
We are stagnating , we are stagnating in so many ways .
SS : A lot more leaning in .
PM : Thank you , Sheryl .
SS : Thank you .
Good morning !
Are you awake ?
Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
He said , &quot; Sorry ? . &quot;
I said , &quot; The menu , please . &quot;
&quot; I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; menu &quot; , or &quot; menu &quot; . &quot;
Is the French pronunciation correct ?
How could she speak that way ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It made me mad . It definitely hurts !
I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
Where could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
To be one of them ?
Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
Arabic is the mother tongue .
How ?
So , this is an example no one can argue with .
They make it sacred .
Do we know better than them ?
They kept it close to them .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
Regardless of the who , how and why .
What is our intellect ?
How would you feel ?
I asked her once how things were going .
He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; How could anyone be this cruel ?
Does she want to commit suicide ?
Translate that for me .
No problem !
We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
We &apos;d have to find an existence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
Photos of &quot; cool &quot; guys and girls .
We are very cool !
Creativity is the idea .
Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
A single novel could make us global again .
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
In conclusion , what can you do today ?
Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Now I will tell you a secret .
A baby first identifies its father through language .
Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe .
Diana Nyad : Never , ever give up
The team is proud of our four attempts .
It &apos;s an expedition of some 30 people .
And I &apos;m thinking , what are they imagining ?
And we &apos;ve been on a journey .
Isn &apos;t life about the journey , not really the destination ?
And it was deep . It was deep in my soul .
That &apos;s always there and it &apos;s undeniable .
But it was deeper . It was , how much life is there left ?
And so of course I want to make it across .
But the journey itself was worthwhile taking .
And now we &apos;re there .
You &apos;ve never seen black this black .
Now there &apos;s a talent unto itself .
And then there are the crises . Of course there are .
It &apos;s difficult to swim in .
And the hypothermia sets in .
It &apos;s gorgeous .
That &apos;s the everyday machinations .
What a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons .
The epic journey is going to be over .
That little tracker that was on the computer ?
We did it . I didn &apos;t do it . We did it .
I live it . What &apos;s the phrase from today from Socrates ?
To be is to do .
So I don &apos;t stand up and say , don &apos;t ever give up .
I didn &apos;t give up , and there was action behind these words .
Yeah .
Thank you .
Bonnie , where are you ?
Where are you ?
There &apos;s Bonnie Stoll . My buddy .
And yeah , I stand before you now .
I &apos;ve signed a wonderful major book contract .
All of that &apos;s great , and I don &apos;t denigrate it .
Thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Find a way !
Boyd Varty : What I learned from Nelson Mandela
And so this talk is going to be for him .
I grew up in wonder .
I grew up amongst those animals .
Ubuntu : I am because of you .
Ubuntu is at play right now .
Solly grew up tending to his father &apos;s cattle .
We worked together as a team .
Solly remained on the bank .
Wham ! It hits me by my right leg .
It &apos;s shaking me violently .
He turns . He begins to make his way to me .
The croc again continues to shake me .
It goes to bite me a second time .
The bone is cracked .
The meat is torn up .
He comes straight into the channel .
He gets to me . He grabs me .
I &apos;m still in a vulnerable position .
He turns . He walks me up the bank .
He lays me down . He pulls his shirt off .
And I survive .
Danger is shared . Pain is shared .
Joy is shared . Achievement is shared .
Houses are shared . Food is shared .
And then I met this young lady .
Her name was Elvis .
It was sort of a hollow in the ground .
The rest of the herd turned and began to follow .
Thank you .
Boyd Varty : Well thanks , Pat .
I &apos;m so happy because it was time for him to pass on .
He was suffering .
And so of course there &apos;s the mixed emotions .
PM : Thank you . BV : Thank you . Thanks very much .
&quot; Give me liberty or give me death . &quot;
Who could blame them ?
This schism has only grown wider .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
Of course they would .
And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights .
It &apos;s not just in economics , but it &apos;s also in terms of living standards .
We see that in China , 28 percent of people had secondary school access .
Today , it &apos;s closer to 82 percent .
So in its totality , economic improvement has been quite significant .
Today , the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world .
I want to be able to do what China &apos;s doing .
That is the system that seems to work . &quot;
What might that world look like ?
And I suggest that they have two options .
The West can either compete or cooperate .
Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights .
At its very best , the Western model speaks for itself .
It &apos;s the model that put food on the table .
It &apos;s the refrigerators .
It put a man on the moon .
Just to illustrate , I went into my annals of myself .
That &apos;s a picture of me .
Awww . I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969 .
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government .
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty .
Thank you very much .
Abha Dawesar : Life in the &quot; digital now &quot;
I wasn &apos;t the only one .
They &apos;re both stories , interpretations .
It needs months and years .
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters .
But the story is not about these chapters .
It &apos;s the whole book .
Without it , we would have no music .
I think that technology has altered that flow of time .
What happens when that arrow goes awry ?
What happens when time warps ?
We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time .
Far away over there is now here .
And that &apos;s not all .
Are you reading an interview by an author ?
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror .
How does one live inside distraction ?
Possibly , but I remember my childhood .
It cannot be stored .
At such moments , our selves are complete .
The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future .
The present joins a flow of time from before and after .
Attention is time .
It threatens the flow of love .
But we don &apos;t need to let it .
We can choose otherwise .
We can choose to take time back .
Thank you .
We &apos;re all very aware .
I &apos;m not a social problem guy .
God forbid .
Business is not seen as the solution .
And rightly so , in many cases .
So this perspective is perhaps justified .
Even a business school professor has thought about it that way .
We &apos;re not winning .
We &apos;re making incremental progress .
We can &apos;t scale .
We can make progress . We can show benefits .
We can &apos;t scale .
Why is that ?
Because we don &apos;t have the resources .
And that &apos;s really clear now .
We &apos;ve got to confront that reality .
All wealth is actually created by business .
That &apos;s where all the resources come from .
Only business can actually create resources .
The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business .
The question then is , how do we tap into this ?
How do we tap into this ?
But that profit is the magic .
The solution becomes self-sustaining .
Now what does this all have to do with social problems ?
Business should give more .
Business should be more responsible .
And that &apos;s been the path that we &apos;ve been on in business .
I &apos;m proud of that .
The classic example is pollution .
It &apos;s profitable to have an unsafe working environment .
That &apos;s been the conventional wisdom .
A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom .
They resisted environmental improvement .
They resisted workplace improvement .
That &apos;s a very simplistic view .
That &apos;s where the real profit comes .
Let &apos;s take pollution .
It saves money .
It doesn &apos;t waste resources .
Accidents are expensive and costly .
Another issue is health .
This is an example of Jain Irrigation .
That &apos;s shared value .
It &apos;s real . It &apos;s happening .
We &apos;re now seeing companies embrace this idea .
I know it . I &apos;m seeing it .
I &apos;m feeling it .
Thank you .
Stuart Firestein : The pursuit of ignorance
I &apos;d like to tell you that &apos;s not the case .
So what was the difference ?
This book comes in at 1,414 pages , it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds .
That &apos;s clearly not true .
And that &apos;s not really the case either .
We talk about what we don &apos;t know .
This is the stuff that &apos;s exhilarating and interesting .
It is , if you will , the ignorance .
That &apos;s what was missing .
You can find all sorts of information there . It &apos;s wide open .
That &apos;s another story , perhaps .
I mean a different kind of ignorance .
So it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate .
How can you ever know all of this ?
And indeed , the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate .
I have to get out of here actually . I have to go read .
We just don &apos;t worry about it , in a way .
But knowing a lot of stuff doesn &apos;t make you a scientist .
We don &apos;t have any such guarantee .
Indeed , there are many of us who aren &apos;t so sure about the manufacturer .
So I think the puzzle model doesn &apos;t work .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the way it works either .
Or make it manageable . But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case .
So the knowledge generates ignorance .
This is really well said , I thought , by George Bernard Shaw .
I love that term , &quot; question propagation , &quot; this idea of questions propagating out there .
It &apos;s rather kind of the other way around , really .
What do we use this knowledge for ?
What are we using this collection of facts for ?
Because , you know , there &apos;s low-quality ignorance and there &apos;s high-quality ignorance . It &apos;s not all the same .
Scientists argue about this all the time .
Sometimes we call them bull sessions .
Sometimes we call them grant proposals .
But nonetheless , it &apos;s what the argument is about .
It &apos;s the ignorance . It &apos;s the what we don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s what makes a good question .
So how do we think about these questions ?
Doesn &apos;t know much but they have a lot of interest .
They &apos;re interested in almost everything .
So the important thing here is that this can all be changed .
Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions .
Because it &apos;s not always quite so straightforward .
So , for example , we could say , well what is it that the brain does ?
Well , one thing the brain does , it moves us around .
We walk around on two legs .
That seems kind of simple , somehow or another .
So that maybe is not that interesting .
So instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at .
How about the visual system ?
There it is , the visual system .
You ask them to go up an inclined plane , and they fall over .
Turn around , and they fall over . It &apos;s a serious problem .
What ought we to be studying ?
How do we turn molecules into perceptions ?
What &apos;s the process by which that could happen ?
So there are two really interesting questions here , it seems to me .
And you don &apos;t even think about it , do you ?
This is a tricky thing . This is not such an easy business .
We just can &apos;t sell facts for a living anymore .
How do we do that ?
Well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
They like to investigate things . They go to science museums .
They like to play around . They &apos;re in second grade .
They &apos;re interested .
Is this what we want ?
You know . You can imagine what it is .
This can &apos;t possibly continue to go on .
Geneticists always say , you always get what you screen for .
And that &apos;s meant as a warning .
It amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time with this kind of feedback .
That &apos;s the one I like in particular .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I had just gone through a breakup .
So there is a catch . There is a catch .
Xu Liu : Test mice .
To do this , there &apos;s only two simple steps to follow .
As simple as that .
SR : Are you convinced ?
But memory is not .
So yeah , this task does seem to be daunting .
But luckily , we got help from the brain itself .
You &apos;re actually looking at the cross-section of a memory right now .
It shouldn &apos;t take minutes or hours to work .
SR : So what do you think , Xu ?
So Steve , how about let &apos;s zap the brain with electricity ?
XL : Yep . You heard it right .
SR : So let &apos;s put all of this to the test now .
Do I sit here and pretend like I don &apos;t exist ? &quot;
XL : And this is what we saw .
It &apos;s interesting .
It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body .
Clearly it &apos;s freezing .
SR : &quot; Did that just work ? &quot;
XL : &quot; Yes , &quot; I said . &quot; Indeed it worked ! &quot;
We &apos;re really excited about this .
Maybe we can take a look at some of those .
Could we possibly even turn it into a false memory ?
Yes we can .
It &apos;s sort of like making a remix tape .
SR : So how do we do this ?
We &apos;re just trying to connect the two .
How do we push this technology forward ?
Thank you . XL : Thank you .
Peter Attia : Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem ?
That wasn &apos;t being asked .
The cancer was too advanced .
I brought some for her parents .
She was fat .
I mean , how hard can it be ?
I &apos;d like to say I don &apos;t know .
But I actually do .
She ate too much . She got unlucky .
She got diabetes . Case closed .
Three years later , I found out how wrong I was .
But this time , I was the patient .
Some of you may have heard of this .
I had become insulin-resistant .
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo .
You treat the obesity .
But what if we have it backwards ?
Cause and effect .
Let &apos;s look at some suggestive facts .
I &apos;m betting my career on this .
Some think it &apos;s too many calories consumed .
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.
seven years ago .
I wish I could speak with that woman again .
I &apos;d like to tell her how sorry I am .
Paul Pholeros : How to reduce poverty ? Fix homes
The idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal .
I &apos;ll leave that to others .
But I do have an idea , and that idea is called Housing for Health .
Housing For Health works with poor people .
It works in the places where they live , and the work is done to improve their health .
Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs .
He got a medical doctor .
He got an environmental health guy .
And he hand-selected a team of local Aboriginal people to work on this project .
Always a good start , no money .
You have six months .
That was our task .
&#91; Washing , clothes , wastewater , nutrition ... &#93; Now , I was very , very unimpressed .
Come on .
This didn &apos;t fit the bill .
The pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason .
Now , I &apos;m going to ask you all a very personal question .
I &apos;m going to ask you to do some more work .
Okay . Let &apos;s see if your shower in that house is working .
I hear some &quot; aw &quot; s and I hear some &quot; aah . &quot;
You and your kids are fine .
Why ? Because you &apos;re all too old .
They leave a lifelong remnant .
You can &apos;t hear as well for the rest of your life .
And the same test for the electrical system and the toilets .
Housing for Health projects aren &apos;t about measuring failure .
They &apos;re actually about improving houses .
That &apos;s our average budget .
At the end of six months to a year , we test every house again .
It &apos;s very easy to spend money .
Thank you . The teams do a great job , and that &apos;s their work .
Why are the houses in such poor condition ?
Things wear out .
Should have been done by state government or local government .
Simply not done , the house doesn &apos;t work .
They don &apos;t work . We have to fix them .
And we &apos;ll go a lot further than that .
They do all aspects of the work .
Our work &apos;s always had a focus on health . That &apos;s the key .
The developing world bug trachoma , it causes blindness .
Okay , what do we do ?
Well , first thing we do , we get showers working .
Why ? Because that flushes the bug out .
We wash the bug out .
We call up the doctor of dust , and there is such a person .
He was loaned to us by a mining company .
So we used dirt to stop dust .
We tested and we reduced the dust .
Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally .
So how do we do that ?
We changed the environment , not just treated the eyes .
And finally , you get a good eye .
A 40-percent reduction .
Health was poor .
It was choking with smoke .
People were cooking on their only fuel source , green timber .
So all of a sudden we had two problems .
But all of a sudden now there was a second problem .
I put it to you , is this eliminating poverty ?
And I don &apos;t pretend anything else .
Well over 1,000 people use those toilets .
Yami Lama , he &apos;s a young boy .
Kanji Maya , she &apos;s a mother and a proud one .
Surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber when it &apos;s shed the gas , he puts it on his crops .
And that , to me , is the key .
People are not the problem .
We &apos;ve never found that .
Thank you very much for your time .
Didier Sornette : How we can predict the next financial crisis
